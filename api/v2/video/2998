We'll summarise our experience and discuss our\r\nplans for the future development of Stackless.\r\n\r\nThe talk will be help by Anselm Kruis and Christian Tismer.\r\nIf we are lucky, we will also welcome Kristj\u00e1n Valur J\u00f3nsson from Iceland.\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/H3sQLC40GXU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/H3sQLC40GXU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/H3sQLC40GXU/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3sQLC40GXU", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-23", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:30.722", "updated": "2014-08-01T08:23:06.430"}
