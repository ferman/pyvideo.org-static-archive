SQLAlchemy exposes the full\npower of SQL while remaining easy to use for the basics, and is flexible\nenough to work with existing database schemas as well as fresh designs.\nSQLAlchemy is used in production by leading Python web frameworks Pylons and\nTurbogears as well as many other web and non-web developers.\n\nThis tutorial teaches SQLAlchemy's object-relational mapping to automate\npainlessly loading and persisting objects from and to your database, even when\ncomplex relationships exist.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nPython experience: intermediate. You should already have some hands-on\nexperience with Python and be comfortable reading modern Python code.\n\nSQL experience: beginning. You should know how to SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE,\nand how to read queries involving JOINs, but we will only be reading the SQL\ngenerated by SA, not writing our own.\n\nORM experience: prior experience with an object-relational mapper is not\nnecessary.\n\nClass Outline\n\nIntroduction:\n\n  * Philosophy \n  * SA features \n\nFundamentals:\n\n  * Introduction to ORM \n  * Data Mapper pattern vs Active Record \n  * Tables \n  * Mapping basics \n\nQueries:\n\n  * Conditions, operators \n  * Joins \n  * lazy / eager loading \n  * Relation-based queries \n\nSessions & identity map:\n\n  * detatching, attaching objects \n  * Lifecycle relations \n\nMore Mapping:\n\n  * one to one, many to many \n  * backreferences \n\nExtensions, etc.:\n\n  * DDL \n  * Migrate \n  * FormAlchemy \n  * SqlSoup \n  * Elixir \n\nRequirements\n\nLaptop with Python 2.5 or 2.6 and SQLAlchemy 0.6 installed. Code samples may\nalso work with Python 2.4 but will not be tested on that platform. SQLAlchemy\nalso supports Jython and cPython 3.x, but this tutorial will be using\n\"classic\" cPython.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010IntroductionToSQLAlchemy295-517.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 884586519, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/252_introduction-to-sqlalchemy.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/252_introduction-to-sqlalchemy.m4v", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2010-02-19", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.135"}
