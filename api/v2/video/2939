Undoubtedly, buildout is more powerful for building in that regard and there is no reason to switch to PyBuilder.\r\n\r\nHowever, for simple projects (a few packages, pure python) we believe that PyBuilder is better, especially if you're starting out with Python. The plugin architecture (as opposed to recipes) makes it easier to reason about what is going on. We are able to model dependencies between build phases  (like \"coverage\" needing \"unit tests\" and \"packaging\" needing \"integration tests\") where recipes are not. It also seems (after looking through the recipes available for buildout) that we have more focus on QA as part of the build process (lint code, differentiate between unit/integration tests, code analysis, ...). \r\n\r\nThere is also a special focus on having the build descriptor written in Python (with fluent interfaces where possible) so that it is possible to understand what the configuration is by reading plain english, as opposed to zc.buildout (where the configuration is an ini file, or SCons which is very make-oriented).\r\n\r\nIn the end, a big difference between most build tools and PyBuilder is that PyBuilder is more about orchestration. We didn't reinvent packaging or linting,  we simply use what is already there (setuptools, flake8, pymetrics, ...). This allows users to use the tools they want without having to do the integration themselves, and still get a nice, unified build process out of it.\r\n\r\nA simple example :\r\n\r\nIn buildout, code analysis can be done with \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[buildout]\r\nparts += code-analysis\r\n\r\n[code-analysis]\r\nrecipe = plone.recipe.codeanalysis\r\ndirectory = ${buildout:directory}/src\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not readable IMHO.\r\nIn PyBuilder it can look like this :\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse_plugin('python.flake8')\r\nproject.set_property('flake8_include_test_sources', True)\r\nproject.set_property('flake8_ignore', 'E501')\r\nproject.set_property('flake8_break_build', True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### \"It provides glue between existing build frameworks\" - which ones ? Could you name (some at least) ?\r\n\r\nCurrently there is only a plugin for building with distutils/setuptools. Should that change (e.G. new contender) it would be easy to switch using PyBuilder.\r\n\r\nExamples where glue is needed : \r\n\r\n* Glue setuptools + unittest, so that no distribution can be shipped if tests fail\r\n* Glue setuptools + coverage + unittest, so that no distribution can be shipped if the statement coverage is too low (configurable ofc)\r\n* Glue setuptools + pip so that cloned projects can be built with their dependencies without needing to pip install manually", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/iQU18hAjux4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/iQU18hAjux4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/iQU18hAjux4/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQU18hAjux4", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-25", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:23.974", "updated": "2014-07-31T01:05:09.971"}
