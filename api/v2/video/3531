It is an all\u00adin\u00adone open source solution that provides a 100% native python alternative to hybrid solutions based on Spark.\n\nThe talk is derived from the presentation made at MariaDB community event (https://mariadb.org/en/community-events/). The presentation of Wendelin Full Stack will be shorter than in Santa Clara in order to provide enough time to present the first implementation for Wind Turbines. We will show in particular which parts of data analysis are handled on server side with pydata libraries, which parts of data analysis are handled on browser side in javascript and how both can be integrated to minimize implementation costs.\n\nThe talk concludes on Wendelin platform roadmap.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "youtube", "embed": "<iframe type='text/html' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/kyp8vHnpUXE' width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'/>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kyp8vHnpUXE/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyp8vHnpUXE", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2015-04-14", "added": "2015-04-22T17:59:39.370", "updated": "2015-04-22T17:59:39.370"}
