Almost\nten years later, Web developers are still confused as to how to apply the REST\nprinciples in their applications. Examples of poorly designed 'REST' APIs\nabound, and I will make use of them in my talk.\n\n  \nIn this presentation, I will give an overview of REST and its design\nprinciples, and I will show a concrete example of a RESTful Web service\nimplemented in the restish framework. My examples will include CRUD\noperations, as well as transactions. I will also show how to consume this Web\nservice using both httplib2 and curl. I would be remiss if I didn't describe\nways to test the Web service with WebTest and twill.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010CreatingRESTfulWebServicesWithRestish17893.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 506397358, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/301_creating-restful-web-services-with-restish-17.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/301_creating-restful-web-services-with-restish-17.m4v", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2010-02-19", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.091"}
