Over the years, I've committed my share of\nsins; now it's time to come clean. Step right up for a tour of twisted, evil,\nand downright wrong code, and learn some strategies to avoid writing\ncriminally bad code--if you dare!\n\nAbstract\n\nWhat does it look like when good intentions go horribly wrong? This talk will\ntake a tour through pathological code from my past (as well as some\ncontributions from friends, coworkers, and the community), featuring such\nterrors as:\n\n  * Lies, Damn Lies, and Hungarian Notation \n  * Crimes Against PEP-8 \n  * The Diaper Pattern \n  * The Beast With a Thousand Elifs \n  * The Mile-Long Club \n  * God Objects and God Methods \n  * The Malignant Menace of Mutable Keyword Arguments \n  * The Seductive Lure of Global State \n  * Slower Applications Through DTO Bondage \n  * A Twisty Maze of Single-Character Variables, All Alike \n  * Lambdas, Lambdas Everywhere \n  * The List Comprehension That Ate Cincinnati \n  * Adventures in Wheel Reinvention \n  * New and Creative Ways to Break the Build \n\n...as well as others as time permits.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011ExhibitionOfAtrocity736.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 141638939, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/401_exhibition-of-atrocity.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.968"}
