Over the next few years I became a frequent contributor to Django, including becoming a core developer and later a member of the DSF board. Now I'm largely uninvolved with Django's development. This talk is the story of my time with Django. This talk is a walk through my time with Django -- from emailing Adrian to ask about attending a sprint that had already happened, to contributing patches, to the multi-db GSOC, to Eric Florenzano's keynote, becoming a core developer, joining the board, to slowly fading away and becoming an emeritus developer.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3IGbdwU1aXQ/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 838, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/3IGbdwU1aXQ", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-07-11", "added": "2015-07-05T19:09:39.207", "updated": "2015-07-16T21:30:49.781"}
