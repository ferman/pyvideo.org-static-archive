While originally written for with astronomical data, it can be used for any kind of map provided that the projection and coordinate system can be represented by a pixel-to-world transformation.", "description": "Astronomical data (whether images on the sky, or other data) are typically stored with information about their corresponding projection (Gnomonic, Mercator, Conical, Aitoff, and *many* more) and coordinate system (Equatorial, Galactic, Ecliptic, and so on).\r\n\r\nI will present [WCSAxes](https://github.com/astrofrog/wcsaxes \"WCSAxes\"), a new framework for plotting such astronomical data, developed as part of the [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org) project. WCSAxes consists primarily of a [Matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org \"Matplotlib\") Axes sub-class that seamlessly handles the plotting of ticks, tick labels, and grid lines for arbitrary coordinate systems and projections.\r\n\r\nAs an example, the following plot was produced with WCSAxes:\r\n\r\n![The Galactic Center as seen by Chandra](http://www.mpia.de/~robitaille/chandra_avm_small.png \"The Galactic center as seen by the Chandra X-ray observatory\")\r\n\r\n(Image Credit: NASA/CXC/UMass/D. Wang et al. - [http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/gcenter/](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/gcenter/))\r\n\r\nSince it is a sub-class of the Matplotlib Axes class, all the default Matplotlib methods such as plot, scatter, imshow, contour, as well as patches, lines, collections, and so on are supported, and WCSAxes - in combination with Matplotlib's ability to accept arbitrary transformations - makes it very easy to define whether the plotting should apply to pixel coordinates, or a world coordinate system related to the data.\r\n\r\nWCSAxes has been designed as a framework that can be easily used in other Python tools, and it is planned for inclusion in [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org), [APLpy](http://aplpy.github.io), and other astronomical tools. While originally written for Astronomical images, it should be easily extendable to any kind of map (such as Earth-based geospatial data) provided that the projection and coordinate system can be represented by a pixel-to-world transformation.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/ukR5a2TJJt4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/ukR5a2TJJt4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ukR5a2TJJt4/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukR5a2TJJt4", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-09", "added": "2014-07-09T19:24:52.816", "updated": "2014-07-14T14:06:51.100"}
