If this is the case, then it must follow that the best software will have the most features and the fewest bugs. In this talk I will try to convince you that this is a horrible way of thinking about software, especially in the context of open source projects. To accomplish this goal, I will use the development of the IPython Notebook as a case study in software engineering. I will describe what we learned in our numerous missteps, what we did right and how the eventual success of the IPython Notebook radically changed how I view software development. This will clarify why feature and complexity creep need to be actively guarded against and how a well defined scope can help in that battle. I will propose an informal framework for evaluating new feature requests and discuss the social/community aspects of saying no to new features within a project. Finally, I will try to convince you that bugs are a sign of quality software and a healthy community. If I am successful, you will want to go home and write buggy software with as few features as possible.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/OrpPDkZef5I?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/OrpPDkZef5I?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/OrpPDkZef5I/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrpPDkZef5I", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2013-07-01", "added": "2013-07-04T10:08:37", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.455"}
