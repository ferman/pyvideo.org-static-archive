The solutions proposed by the developers of MPI and the new languages in this space are all addressing the problem the way it's always been addressed. What I present is a way to attack the massively parallel problem that reduces the complexity of MPI programming to that of implementing a very simple state machine. I've used this combination of MPI and IoC to write state-of-the-art applications that run on some of the largest supercomputers around the world.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h4gYrAuKgqM/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 1516, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/h4gYrAuKgqM", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-09-05", "added": "2015-09-14T05:45:19.601", "updated": "2015-09-16T04:33:17.101"}
