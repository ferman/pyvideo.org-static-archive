The standard facilities are useful out of the box, but,\nsometimes, you need a bit more. Not surprisingly, it turns out that the\nlogging module is designed to be extended. This presentation shows some of the\nthings you can do; things like gathering statistics on message type, directing\nemails to different recipients depending on severity, dynamic updating of\nattributes, and logging to a database. The examples are based on the\nnotification facilities in Lokai. The talk covers: an overview of why I\nthought I needed the extra features, a look at the logger structures that need\nto be changed, and some actual code that does the job. I\u2019m sure there are many\ndifferent ways of doing this. Some of the code might be obvious in retrospect,\nand some might be surprising. Whatever the case, if you havn\u2019t thought of\ndoing this before you might be encouraged to give it a go. And if you have\ndone it before you can always come and heckle.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/m8mS28xBh_A?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/m8mS28xBh_A?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m8mS28xBh_A/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8mS28xBh_A", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2012-07-04", "added": "2012-09-06T22:33:23", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.276"}
