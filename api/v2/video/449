As it\nturns out, Python is very capable for prototyping low level network code,\ncollecting data, and testing ideas quickly without getting lost in the land of\nC.\n\nAbstract\n\nWhile not as robust as C, Python provides a simple and elegant solution for\nmany cases to either prove a theory or gather data before developing a more\nrobust solution. Obscure topics such as raw sockets, multicast, network\nbridging, rolling your own vpn, and disruption tolerant networking will be\ncovered. Use of Python can enable building a custom protocols, debugging a\nnetwork, fixing broken nets, custom logging and processing, and simulation of\nnetworks. The author will talk about his experiences using Python on Linux for\nextreme network programming and possibilities for future efforts.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011ExtremeNetworkProgrammingWithPythonAndLinux128.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 192624692, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/449_extreme-network-programming-with-python-and-linux.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.969"}
