A software that would have been extremely difficult to create, for a tiny shop as BioDec, without leveraging the language itself and projects such as BioPython, Scipy, Plone, and Web2py.\nWe will try to distill some of the lessons that we learned from more than ten years of experience dealing with machine-learning-intensive applications and large data sets with open-source software and Python.\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_BSipQpaoRg/maxresdefault.jpg", "duration": 1456, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BSipQpaoRg", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-05-29", "added": "2015-06-14T17:04:24.335", "updated": "2015-06-14T17:04:24.335"}
