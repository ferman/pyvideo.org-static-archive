And there is a real\ntransformation in the way we design and build products at work behind all that\nbuzz.\n\nBut the fundamental principle behind all of them is applying scientific and\nexperimental methodologies to product design decision making. The tools of\nLean Startups are:\n\n  * Data collection and analysis\n  * Writing hypothesis and models\n  * Creating experiments to test those models\n  * Learning from those experiments, and refining/redesigning the model\n\nFortunately Python is a great tool for those looking to apply data science to\nproduct design.\n\nPython can help with everything from statistical analysis, to rapid\ndevelopment of viable products, to the creation of complex models that can be\nused to tweak the levers of growth, and it\u2019s easy to combine these with off\nthe shelf tools that help you analyze traffic patterns and figure out what\nproduct changes actually make a difference.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/tzXWTrpCyCM?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/tzXWTrpCyCM?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/tzXWTrpCyCM/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzXWTrpCyCM", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2012-08-21", "added": "2013-01-15T14:29:54", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.047"}
