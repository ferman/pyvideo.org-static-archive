The material on the\n[http://pystar.org](http://pystar.org/) site was originally developed by the\nBoston Python Workshop which was held March 4/5, 2011. Currently PyStar events\nuse a mix of badges from the PyStar site and their own curriculum. As this\nproject continues hopefully this site will be a hub of learning materials\ngeared at all levels of Python learners, with a focus on teaching people in a\nsafe and supportive manner.\n\n", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Gloriajw-BoostingTheNumbersPythonForWomenAndDoingDistributedOrga216-163.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 187294684, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2011/496_pygotham-2011-boosting-the-numbers-python-for-women-and-doing-distributed-organizing-of-workshops.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2011/496_pygotham-2011-boosting-the-numbers-python-for-women-and-doing-distributed-organizing-of-workshops.m4v", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.805"}
