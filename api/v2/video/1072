Still, what does one\nneed to do to best leverage this awesome combination? And more importantly,\nwhat crucial advantages exist to decide its adoption in favour of more\ntraditional tecniques?\n\nDuring this training, we'll start from a white canvas and show how to develop\na desktop application using the best tools Qt offers. You'll learn how to\ncompose complex GUIs from basic building blocks, and how to use QPainter, one\nof the most advanced 2D painting systems in the open source world. Qt's Webkit\nintegration will be discussed, along with the recent Qt Quick technology,\nwhich allows one to create smooth and fluid user interfaces. Qt's solution to\ncommon deployment problems, like handling a serious translation workflow, will\nbe presented. At the end, we'll package our PyQt application so it's ready to\nbe distributed for download.\n\nWalk away with a sound understanding of why you should choose PyQt for your\nnext desktop project.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/6ko-tO-3bJ0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/6ko-tO-3bJ0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/6ko-tO-3bJ0/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ko-tO-3bJ0", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-07-18", "added": "2012-08-30T21:02:23", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.775"}
