Understanding these observations and connecting them to astrophysical mechanisms requires not only detailed modeling of the underlying physics but reliable reproduction of the observed phenomena. I present a method of creating synthetic X-ray observations from numerical simulations, which leverages several astronomical Python libraries, including [yt](http://yt-project.org \\\"yt\\\"), [AstroPy](http://www.astropy.org \\\"AstroPy\\\"), and [PyXspec](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/xanadu/xspec/python/html/ \\\"PyXspec\\\"). I will describe the method of generating the observations, the Python packages used, and applications of the method, including connecting observations of galaxy clusters with MHD simulations and preparing simulations for observation proposals.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/fUMq6rmNshc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/fUMq6rmNshc?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/fUMq6rmNshc/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUMq6rmNshc", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-14", "added": "2014-07-15T22:45:37.534", "updated": "2014-07-15T23:16:31.704"}
