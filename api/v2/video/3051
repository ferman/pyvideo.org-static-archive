On the contary - the law almost self-selects as a career choice for the numerically-challenged. So when the one UK tax that property lawyers generally felt comfortable dealing with (lease duty) was replaced with a new tax (stamp duty land tax) that was both arithmetically demanding and conceptually complex, it was inevitable that significant frustrations would arise. Suddenly, lawyers had to deal with concepts such as net present valuations, aggregation of several streams of fluctuating figures, and constant integration of a complex suite of credits and disregards.
