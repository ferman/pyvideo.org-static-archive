The industry commands 32 billion dollars in annual revenue a year (source: polaris project). As a professor and researcher at NYU I am developing tools to fight this horrible problem. Come learn about the work I've done so far and where my research is going. I will be showing you how recreate some of the tools I've made and used in python. I will be covering web scraping, text processing, and image processing.\r\n\r\nI will be taking folks through a number of web scraping tools that I use to find instances of human trafficking. We will then go through classification algorithms I use to determine genuine instances of trafficking. Finally I will discuss image processing and facial recognition.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "youtube", "embed": "<iframe type='text/html' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/NVsDUos_HHY' width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'/>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NVsDUos_HHY/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVsDUos_HHY", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-09-17", "added": "2014-10-26T18:22:36.374", "updated": "2014-10-26T18:22:36.374"}
