We will report on progress that has been made with astropy since the last scipy conference. The past year has seen much growth in the number and quality of the core libraries in astropy and a public release. We will highlight the new capabilities available, and outline the development plans for the upcoming year. Finally we discuss the strategies for advertising its capabilities and growing the documentation and tutorials available for users and developers.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/0wfxxpM75vM?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/0wfxxpM75vM?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0wfxxpM75vM/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wfxxpM75vM", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2013-07-01", "added": "2013-07-04T10:08:32", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.384"}
