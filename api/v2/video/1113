No longer merely a\nresearch project, PyPy is now suitable for production use. We are working on\nimprovements on calling into C libraries and generally integrating with the\nexisting Python extensions ecosystem.\n\nWe will give an overview on how the tracing Just-in-Time compiler works in\nPyPy. From there, we will then focus on what the PyPy project has achieved,\nparticularly in the past two years:\n\n  * most Python benchmarks run much faster than with CPython or Psyco\n\n  * the real-world PyPy compiler toolchain itself (200 KLocs) runs twice as fast\n\n  * already supports 32 and 64bit x86 and is in the process of supporting ARM\n\n  * full compatibility with CPython (more than Jython/IronPython)\n\n  * full (and JIT-ed) ctypes support to call C libraries from Python\n\n  * supports Stackless Python (in-progress)\n\n  * new \"cpyext\" layer which integrates existing CPython C extensions\n\n  * an experimental super-fast JIT-compilation of calls to C++ libraries\n\nWe want to reserve time for discussing potential future work like SWIG and/or\nCython compatibility and other areas brought up by the audience. There are\nmany interesting details that can be explored further; we will focus on the\npoints the audience is most interested in.\n\nFor more info:\n\n  * [http://pypy.org/](http://pypy.org/)\n\n  * Our blog: [http://morepypy.blogspot.com/](http://morepypy.blogspot.com/)\n\n  * Eureka program: [http://www.eurostars-eureka.eu/](http://www.eurostars-eureka.eu/)\n\n_Eurostars Eureka is our funding source since 2009.
