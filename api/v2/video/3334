Implementing this algorithm properly and efficiently remains however a challenging task involving issues that are easily overlooked if not considered with care. In this talk, we present the Random Forests implementation developed within the Scikit-Learn machine learning library. In particular, we describe the iterative team efforts that led us to gradually improve our codebase and eventually make Scikit-Learn's Random Forests one of the most efficient implementations in the scientific ecosystem, across all libraries and programming languages. Algorithmic and technical optimizations that have made this possible include:\r\n\r\n* An efficient formulation of the decision tree algorithm, tailored for Random Forests;\r\n* Cythonization of the tree induction algorithm;\r\n* CPU cache optimizations, through low-level organization of data into contiguous memory blocks;\r\n* Efficient multi-threading through GIL-free routines;\r\n* A dedicated sorting procedure, taking into account the properties of data;\r\n* Shared pre-computations whenever critical.\r\n\r\nOverall, we believe that lessons learned from this case study extend to a broad range of scientific applications and may be of interest to anybody doing data analysis in Python.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "youtube", "embed": "<iframe type='text/html' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/TqF0rKzvjm4' width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'/>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TqF0rKzvjm4/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqF0rKzvjm4", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-10-22", "added": "2014-11-05T22:41:04.483", "updated": "2014-11-05T22:42:28.662"}
