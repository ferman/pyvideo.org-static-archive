Therefore, after having defined our own (mathematical) model, machine learning is about writing code - sometimes a lot of - to actually make the model to work.  However, one point usually underestimated or omitted when dealing with machine learning algorithms is how to write good quality code.\r\n\r\nTest-driven development (TDD) is one of the most popular agile methods, specifically designed to support developers in producing (potential) less-buggy code by writing tests before the actual code under test.  The application of test-first programming principles to the implementation of Naive Bayes classifiers or Neural networks looks like a daunting challenge. \r\n\r\nConversely, the test-code-refactor cycle strategy founds its principles in the scientific method: make a proposition of validity, share results, work in feedback loops.  Moreover, this kind of approach to tackle problems, in this particular case would also allow for a better understanding of how the whole learning model works under the hood.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, examples of Test-Driven implementations of some of the most famous machine learning algorithms will be presented using scikit-learn.\r\n\r\nThe talk is intended for an intermediate audience.  The content of the talk is intended to be mostly practical, and code oriented. Thus a good proficiency with the Python language is required.  Conversely, no prior knowledge about TDD nor Machine Learning algorithms is necessary to attend this talk.\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JlcDw2V9JJY/maxresdefault.jpg", "duration": 2425, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlcDw2V9JJY", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-05-30", "added": "2015-06-14T17:02:21.558", "updated": "2015-06-14T17:32:26.618"}
