Bob was involved in many Python projects but\r\nargues that for some domains there may be better methods found\r\nelsewhere. He started looking for alternatives back in 2006 when\r\nbuilding high concurrency services at Mochi Media (originally with\r\nTwisted), which led him to the land of Erlang and later Haskell. Bob is\r\ngoing to talk about what he learned along the way. In particular, he\u2019ll\r\ncover some techniques that are used in functional programming languages\r\nand how they can be used to solve problems in more performant, robust\r\nand/or concise ways than the standard practices in Python. He is also\r\ngoing to discuss some potential ways that the Python language and its\r\nlibrary ecosystem could evolve accordingly.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/eVChXmNjV7o?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/eVChXmNjV7o?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/eVChXmNjV7o/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVChXmNjV7o", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-21", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:35.949", "updated": "2014-08-02T13:30:43.494"}
