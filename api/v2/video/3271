We built-out some substantial infrastructure, coding primarily in Scala, and using JVM-stack libraries. In the past year, we've moved beyond our data business into building predictive analytics applications for Sales and Marketing teams, so it was necessary to build a data science/machine learning stack. While there's plenty of machine-learning tools for the JVM, we felt that the Python ecosystem had many advantages for our use-case (which we'll discuss), and we think we integrated them in a clever way.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm a data scientist and software engineer. Languages of choice are Scala and Python. I have been working with AWS for production for over three years. My interest is in building data analytics applications with cloud computing technologies.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "youtube", "embed": "<iframe type='text/html' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/eFoPCxpQaxc' width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'/>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFoPCxpQaxc/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoPCxpQaxc", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-06-27", "added": "2014-10-26T00:13:24.582", "updated": "2014-10-26T17:14:29.723"}
