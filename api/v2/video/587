So that's pretty interesting on its\nown. But there's plenty more interesting stuff to discuss. It's going to be\nmostly an overview talk. Blender's python integration could possibly span 3\nseparate talks, especially considering the blender game engine's use of it,\nwhich is a separate but interesting talk.\"\n\nChiPy is a group of Chicago Python Programmers, l33t, and n00bs.
