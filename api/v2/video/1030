It was soon discovered that for real-life\nproblems one would need something like \"yield from\", as is described in\nPEP380. At that time, we already had a similar solution called\n'[compose](http://weightless.io/compose)', which we adapted to PEP380.\n\nAfter 5 years working with 'compose', we found a small set of other features\nthat are essential if you want to use Enhanced Generators not only as a way of\nlightweight command scheduling, but also a a pipe-line, or parser. Indeed, the\nlatter concepts are what real co-routines are about.\n\nThis talk introduces what is needed on top of PEPs 342 and 380 based on\nexperience with decomposing big enterprise search engines into co-routines.\nParts of it have been presented on SPA (2008) and EuroPython (2010).\nUnderstanding of Enhanced Generators is a prerequisite.\n\nExperience has shown that the topic is subtle enough to require quite some\ntime for full understanding, hence the suggestion for a 90 min slot.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/yWR00Y6tkC8?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/yWR00Y6tkC8?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/yWR00Y6tkC8/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWR00Y6tkC8", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-07-24", "added": "2012-08-30T21:02:12", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.702"}
