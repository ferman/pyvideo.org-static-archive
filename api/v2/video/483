Try as he\nmight, he can't get his friends to see the logic of this - even though they\nalways pretty-print their own code, in whatever language they write. Go\nfigure. So, Mark will not be talking about that. What will Mark be talking\nabout? Well, um, err... (sound of shuffling papers) ...oh, yeah, here it is:\n'Mark Pesce will be talking about stuff. And things. And how great it all is.\nNo, really. You'll see. Promise.' ? Mark is best-known as the co-inventor of\nVRML, and as panelist/judge on ABC's \"The New Inventors\". The author of five\nbooks and numerous articles, he has a monthly column in NETT magazine, is a\nfrequent contributor to ABC Unleashed, and is a sought-after commentator on\nboth radio and television.
