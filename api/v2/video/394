While it initially gained traction as a scripting language,\nPython's role has continued to expand with Python applications for science\nscaling to hundreds of thousands of cores and bindings to high performance\nlibraries becoming commonplace. This talk is meant as an overview of Python's\nrole in the HPC space.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk is focused on raising awareness of Python in the high performance\ncomputing space. Specific topics include:\n\n  * building the Python interpreter for speed \n  * an overview of bindings to numerical libraries \n  * using GPUs and accelerators with Python \n  * scaling codes with MPI \n  * issues when scaling on very large systems \n  * an overview of successful science codes \n  * a live demonstration of Python running on 163,840 cores \n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011PythonForHighPerformanceComputing720.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 168164468, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/394_python-for-high-performance-computing.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.017"}
