OpenBlock, released\nto the community from the Knight-funded project, EveryBlock.com, is a\nneighborhood news project aiming to provide a framework for \"hyper-local\"\ncivic data. Over the past few years, the open source project has been\nmaintained by the non-profit OpenPlans. Their goal was to simplify and\naccelerate adoption of OpenBlock by making it easier to use. Today, Caktus is\nworking with Ryan Thornburg of the UNC School of Journalism and Mass\nCommunication to bring OpenBlock to rural North Carolina newspapers. Open\nRural aims to leverage OpenBlock to increase access to public records in small\ncommunities. This talk focuses on our experience with OpenBlock as we work to\ndeploy OpenRural in North Carolina.\n\n# Outline\n\n## Introduction\n\n  * What is OpenBlock?\n  * How does it relate to/compare to EveryBock?\n  * When/why might you want to incorporate OpenBlock into a site?\n  * What have we (Caktus) be doing with OpenBlock?\n\n## Geocoding\n\n  * Geocoding is a hard problem to solve\n  * String parsing\n  * Places and locations\n  * Street/block data\n  * 3rd-party geocoder comparison\n\n## Getting Started: Choosing Source for Street/Block Data\n\n  * Pros and Cons of Census (Tiger) Data\n  * Pros and Cons of Other Data Sources\n  * Differences with county data and OpenBlocks preference for cities\n  * Our Experience with Columbus County, NC\n\n## Scrapers\n\n  * What are they?\n  * How do you write them?\n  * Our Experience with Some Scrapers for Columbus County, NC\n  * How we improve data accessibility with ScraperWiki\n\n## The Missing Piece: Data Review and Analysis\n\n  * OpenBlock handles scraping and public viewing, but is missing review and analysis\n  * How successful was the geocoder?\n  * How many news items were added this past week?\n  * Why is my scraper failing to run?\n  * Why did this address fail to geocode?
