The talk will cover the basics of Platform as a Service and introduce Red Hat's open source OpenShift PaaS. There will be a demonstration of how to fire up an auto-scaling spatial app with Python and MongoDB on OpenShift. We will then hit the app with some load to experiment with the scaling spatial goodness.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/katie-miller-cloud-craft-for-spatial-cadets\r\n\r\nhttp://cloudcraft.codemiller.com/", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "CC", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/YI9VNrXYIQM?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/YI9VNrXYIQM?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YI9VNrXYIQM/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 1800, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/YI9VNrXYIQM", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-09-14", "added": "2014-10-14T22:35:42.005", "updated": "2014-10-16T00:06:08.844"}
