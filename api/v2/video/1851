You experiment and find things that work, and things that don't, particularly if you have little programming experience. Sometimes, you proceed down a path that binds your hands later down the road, and a massive refactor is needed. I would like to present a simple testing framework built upon several existing, free technologies (ConfigObj, twill, nose) and models (Page Objects, Scenario Objects, Abstract State Machines) that is easy to configure, extend, and maintain.
