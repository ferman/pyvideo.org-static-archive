So, we developed a new **IPython**-**Reveal.js**-powered **live** slideshow extension, designed specifically to be used **directly** from the IPython notebook and to be as **executable** as the notebook is (because deep inside, it is the notebook itself but rendered with another face), and also powered with a lot of *features* to address the most common tasks performed during the oral presentation and spreading of our scientific work, such as: main slides and nested slides, fragments views, transitions, themes and speaker notes.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, we have developed a new visualization tool for the **IPython Notebook**, suited for the final steps of our scientific research *work-flow*, providing us with, not only an enhanced and new experience in the oral presentation and communication of our results, but also with a super-powerful tool at teaching time, helping us to easily tranfer our concepts and spread our knowledge.\r\n\r\n**Important**\r\n\r\nYou can see the extension in action in the following video link: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc-1FS0l2vg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pc-1FS0l2vg)\r\n\r\nAnd you can also see the source code of the extension at the following repository: [http://github.com/damianavila/live_reveal](http://github.com/damianavila/live_reveal)\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/sZBKruEh0jI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/sZBKruEh0jI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/sZBKruEh0jI/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZBKruEh0jI", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-13", "added": "2014-07-15T22:45:40.778", "updated": "2014-07-16T14:05:51.463"}
