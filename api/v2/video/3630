Even web frameworks like Tornado that already had an own asynchronous IO-loop implementation, can now take advantage of the subgenerator delegation syntax to provide a high degree of concurrency and responsiveness while keeping the simplicity of sequential code.\nThis talk will focus on the new way of writing asynchronous code with Python 3, explaining the concept of futures, coroutines and ioloop. It will complete with a basic demo of running this code on Tornado, comparing its syntax and performance with other popular web frameworks.\n\nIt is also possible to present this topic in a workshop format. Contact me for details.\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tQL-TbDsv0U/maxresdefault.jpg", "duration": 2385, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQL-TbDsv0U", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-05-29", "added": "2015-06-14T17:04:27.374", "updated": "2015-06-14T17:04:27.374"}
