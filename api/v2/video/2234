This talk will pass on the our favourite Python language features and package we've found along the way.\r\nIt will be both a case study in using Python for a large-scale project, and an overview of useful packages.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "CC-BY-SA", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/EGK5jjyUBCQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/EGK5jjyUBCQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/EGK5jjyUBCQ/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 30, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/Using_Python_to_design_configu.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": true, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGK5jjyUBCQ", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2013-07-06", "added": "2013-07-13T01:04:31", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.299"}
