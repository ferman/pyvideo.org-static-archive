Programming languages and\ntechnologies are not religions. Why do we have to compete against each other\nwhen we can take advantage of diversity by sharing our knowledge and learning\nto use the best tools for each job? By promoting this thinking we are\ngathering people from many different open source communities.\n\n  \nThat's our main recipe for the success of initiatives like Coding Dojo Rio,\nPythOnCampus, Dev in Rio, #horaextra and many other social meetings where we\nhave gathered some of the smartest people in Rio's software development\ncommunity.\n\n  \nWith this philosophy, Rio de Janeiro communities are growing and starting to\njell - they are becoming so strongly knit that the whole is greater than the\nsum of the parts.\n\n  \nIn this talk, we would like to share not only our \"methods\" and \"formulas\",\nbut the values and experiences that are leading us to build a strong and\nactive community while having lots of fun.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010SmallActsMakeGreatRevolutionsCraftingPythonAnd957.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 143686099, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/324_small-acts-make-great-revolutions-crafting-python-and-open-source-communities-in-rio-de-janeiro-78.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/324_small-acts-make-great-revolutions-crafting-python-and-open-source-communities-in-rio-de-janeiro-78.m4v", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2010-02-19", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.200"}
