Because these services include access to\nprotected data, all web service clients must authenticate and be authorized to\naccess a particular service. In order to implement the logic for making\nauthentication and authorization decisions in one place, and cleanly apply it\nto any view, we wrote a custom decorator. This talk will cover the basic\nconcepts behind decorators, how to write a decorator, and walk through our\nimplementation of a decorator for authN/authZ.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Nextdayvideo-CustomDecoratorsForAuthenticationAndAuthorization489-643.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 147004946, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pytexas-2011/555_custom-decorators-for-authentication-and-authorization.m4v", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.411"}
