In this scenario, graph databases are the ideal, they are designed and implemented to deal with connected information in a efficient way.\r\nIn this talk I'll explain why NoSQL is necessary in some contexts as an alternative to traditional relational databases. How graph databases allow developers model their domains in a natural way without translating these domain models to an relational model with some artificial data like foreign keys and why is more efficient a graph database than a relational one or even a document database in a high connected environment. Then I'll explain specific characteristics of Neo4J as well as how to use Cypher the neo4j query language through python.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/IZVPsuWODpg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/IZVPsuWODpg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/IZVPsuWODpg/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZVPsuWODpg", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-23", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:29.923", "updated": "2014-08-01T07:48:24.345"}
