In\nfact Python is now the core language for all new features, and is taking over\nall of sourceforge.net.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe path from legacy PHP to modern python tools has been long an bumpy, and\nthis is the story of how we took Python from a single prototype site, to the\ncore technology driving SourceForge.net. I will discuss the mistakes we made\nalong the way, the benefits that sold python, and the real secret behind our\npython transformation.\n\nA few highlights include:\n\n  * How we abused libraries for fun and profit \n  * How a major mistake made us look good \n  * How the python community worked for us \n  * How we couldn't have done it without Django AND TurboGears \n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011ScalingPythonPast100645-312.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 148412657, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/397_scaling-python-past-100.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.029"}
