I will also look into proprietary alternatives and will discuss how they work and why they are not useful. I will show you different libraries used in web scraping and some example code so that you can choose your own personal favourite. I will also tell why writing your own scrapper in scrapy allows you to have more control over the scraping process.", "description": "Who am I ?\r\n=========\r\n* a programmer\r\n* a high school student\r\n* a blogger\r\n* Pythonista\r\n* and tea lover\r\n- Creator of freepythontips.wordpress.com\r\n- I made soundcloud-dl.appspot.com\r\n- I am a main contributor of youtube-dl.\r\n- I teach programming at my school to my friends.\r\n- It's my first programming  related conference.\r\n- The life of a python programmer in Pakistan\r\n\r\nWhat this talk is about ?\r\n==================\r\n- What is Web Scraping  and its usefulness\r\n- Which libraries are available for the job\r\n- Open Source vs proprietary alternatives\r\n- Whaich library is best for which job\r\n- When and when not to use Scrapy\r\n\r\nWhat is Web Scraping ?\r\n==================\r\nWeb scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction) is a \r\ncomputer software technique of extracting information from \r\nwebsites.  - Wikipedia\r\n\r\n###In simple words :\r\nIt is a method to extract data from a website that does not \r\nhave an API or we want to extract a LOT of data which we \r\ncan not do through an API due to rate limiting.\r\n\r\nWe can extract any data through web scraping which we can \r\nsee while browsing the web.\r\n\r\nUsage of web scraping in real life.\r\n============================\r\n- to extract product information\r\n- to extract job postings and internships\r\n- extract offers and discounts from deal-of-the-day websites\r\n- Crawl forums and social websites\r\n- Extract data to make a search engine\r\n- Gathering weather data etc\r\n\r\nAdvantages of Web scraping over using an API \r\n========================\r\n- Web Scraping is not rate limited\r\n- Anonymously access the website and gather data\r\n- Some websites do not have an API\r\n- Some data is not accessible through an API etc\r\n\r\nWhich libraries are available for the job ?\r\n================================\r\nThere are numerous libraries available for web scraping in \r\npython.
