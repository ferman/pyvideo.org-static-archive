These\ngroups inspired us to get a group of Python hackers started the presentation\nwill show how we were able to leverage on the success of other user groups to\nbring our young community forward.\n\nThe various stages of our growth will be presented along with insights on how\nwe managed to find speakers and venues at each point. The presentation will\nthen go through an overview of our current activities, sharing in the process\nhow effective they are in engaging the community. Our plans for the next few\nyears will be presented then a summary will provide advice to anyone who would\nlike to get started organizing a local Python user group.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011MontrealPythonLessonsLearnedFromBootstrapingAP942.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 108545715, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/361_montreal-python-lessons-learned-from-bootstraping-a-python-community.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.999"}
