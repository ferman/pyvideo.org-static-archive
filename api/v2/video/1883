Thereafter, it is common to cluster the located sources into flash-level entities (often comprised of 10^2 - 10^3 sources) using space and time separation thresholds. A previously-used clustering algorithm was a one-off implementation in Fortran, and was designed without reference to the machine learning literature. This study replaces the previous algorithm, which had been wrapped into the Python-based lmatools workflow, with the general-purpose DBSCAN implementation in Python's sklearn package. The legacy code included substantial, file format-specific, I/O boilerplate. The new code clarifies the boundary between algorithm and I/O, and promotes clean integration with the rest of the lmatools infrastructure, aiding maintainability.\n\nA chunked, streamed processing method was developed to account for continuous data rates that may exceed 10^5 four-coordinate (space and time) source vectors per minute. The chunking method exploits known physical limits to lightning flash duration, allowing the N^2 implementation of DBSCAN in sklearn to achieve real-time processing rates within available memory. The streaming technique is expected to be useful in future work as a flexible building block for end-to-end real-time and post-processing scripts and interactive analysis tools.\n\nThe algorithm is expected to find immediate use in our analysis of data from the NSF-sponsored Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry campaign. The open nature of the underlying clustering libraries promotes code reuse by other research groups. Accounts of source-to-flash clustering in the literature are complemented by the availability of this open, objective reference implementation for clustering of lightning mapping datasets.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/0Z17Q22HEMI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/0Z17Q22HEMI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/0Z17Q22HEMI/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z17Q22HEMI", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2013-07-01", "added": "2013-07-01T19:52:05", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.444"}
