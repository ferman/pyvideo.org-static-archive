This presentation will provide an introduction to\ncryptographic tools available to Python/Django applications, appropriate use\ncases for each, proper usage, and operational concerns necessary to operate in\na certified environment. Finally, we will also demonstrate a reusable\napplication that wraps this all up, providing secure key-management\ncapabilities to a running Django environment via the Django admin.\n\n# Why Encrypt?\n\n# Rules of Encryption\n\n  * Don't do it if you don't need it.\n  * Don't write your own.\n  * Understand what you're doing if you do.\n\n# When to encrypt?\n\n## Understand what you're protecting\n\n  * Data\n  * User records\n  * Code\n  * Systems\n\n## Understand your attack vectors\n\n  * Data (backups, revision control)\n  * Systems\n  * Application\n  * Transport\n  * Client\n\n## Understand the types of encryption you might use:\n\n  * Hashing\n\n### Passwords are a special case. Use a key derivation function\n\n  * PBKDF2 \u2013 Upgrade to Django 1.4!\n\n### Algorithms\n\n  * MD5 - fine as a checksum. not fine as a cryptographic hash.\n  * SHA1 - fine as a checksum. becoming less fine as a cryptographic hash every day\n  * SHA2 - so far so good. use as many bits as you can handle.\n\n## Symmetric Encryption\n\n  * Fast\n  * Reversible\n\n### Algorithms\n\n  * Caesar Cipher (for fun puzzles)\n  * DES (don't use)\n  * AES (certified)\n  * Blowfish\n\n## Asymmetric Encryption\n\n  * Slow\n  * One-way\n\n### Algorithms\n\n  * RSA\n  * DSA\n\n#### Uses\n\n##### Signing\n\n###### Web of Trust\n\n  * PGP\n\n###### PKI\n\n##### Encryption\n\n  * PGP\n  * SSL\n  * TLS\n\n# Doing it right\n\n## Use known-good algorithms\n\n  * AES-256\n  * SHA2\n  * RSA\n  * DSA\n\n## Use known-good implementations\n\n  * Open Source is good\n\n## Extra Credit\n\n  * FIPS 140 certified implementations\n  * FIPS 140 / NIST configurations\n\n## Transport (always use HTTPS)\n\n  * Use good algorithms AES-256\n\n## At Rest (insecure servers or backups)\n\n  * Understand the ramifications of key management\n\n# Examples\n\n## Hashing\n\n  * Use a key-derivation function\n\n### Don't be linked-in\n\n  * Salt your hashes (with a secret). \n  * Salt and pepper your hashes if possible (with a known unique value)\n\n## SSL\n\n  * Forced connections\n  * Making the application aware\n  * Hardened cipher selection\n\n### Robust PKI\n\n  * Client authentication\n  * SSL Test Page\n\n## Asymmetric Encryption\n\n### Key Management\n\n  * Using GPG Agent\n  * GPG Manager App\n\n### PGP Files\n\n## Symmetric Encryption\n\n### Key Management\n\n  * Use Asymmetric Encryption\n\n### Use a unique Initialization Vector if possible\n\n  * LoopBack Devices\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/pWCAADXd-DI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/pWCAADXd-DI?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/pWCAADXd-DI/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWCAADXd-DI", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2012-09-05", "added": "2012-10-08T17:39:48", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.984"}
