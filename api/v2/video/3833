It offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as well as a rich set of libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics. Spark is currently one of the most exciting and fastest-growing Apache open source projects.\nThis talk will give an overview of the Apache Spark project and introduce the basics of PySpark, the Python API for Spark. It will then dive a little deeper into PySpark internals, and finally show some examples and a live demo covering PySpark, Spark's SQL engine, and machine learning with Spark's built-in libraries as well as other Python libraries.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-large-scale-data-processing/pyconza2014-large-scale-data-processing.thumbs/5%20B%20Large%20Scale%20Data%20Processing%20-_000570.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-large-scale-data-processing/5%20B%20Large%20Scale%20Data%20Processing%20-.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-large-scale-data-processing/5%20B%20Large%20Scale%20Data%20Processing%20-.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://archive.org/details/pyconza2014-large-scale-data-processing", "whiteboard": "ia scrape", "recorded": "2014-10-02", "added": "2015-08-22T21:43:26.235", "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:26.235"}
