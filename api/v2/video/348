Core feature of Seattle is that it allows safe execution of\nuntrusted code on end-user systems. In our talk we look at how we used Python\nto build a safe, restricted code execution environment for Seattle that not\nonly provides execution safety but also enforces strict resource consumption\nlimits. In addition, Seattle includes a high-level API to hide inconsistent\nOS-specific behaviors from developers. What results is a platform that\nwelcomes the participation of end-user machines for general-purpose\ndistributed programming and creates new possibilities for developers.\n\n  \n[http://seattle.cs.washington.edu/](http://seattle.cs.washington.edu/)\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Beginning of talk missing, due to technical problems.]\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010SeattleAPythonbasedPlatformForEasyDevelopmentAn600-243.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 177494848, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/348_seattle-a-python-based-platform-for-easy-development-and-deployment-of-networked-systems-and-applications-162.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/348_seattle-a-python-based-platform-for-easy-development-and-deployment-of-networked-systems-and-applications-162.m4v", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2010-02-19", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.198"}
