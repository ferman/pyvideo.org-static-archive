It was designed and implemented as part of\nthe Landscape project at Canonical in mid-2006 and was open sourced in\nmid-2007. Since then it's been used in a variety of projects, in production\nfor many years, and has received numerous enhancements and bug fixes. The\nfeatures of Storm will be explained with a series of examples and with\ndiscussion about what's happening in each one. In addition to describing the\nconcepts and features that a developer needs to understand, a variety of best\npractices will be shared, to help developers make the best use of Storm.\n\nThe examples in this talk assume that participants have a good understanding\nof SQL, transactions, relationships between tables and other common database\nconcepts.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/JC5QqVWA8Vo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/JC5QqVWA8Vo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/JC5QqVWA8Vo/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC5QqVWA8Vo", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-07-13", "added": "2012-08-30T21:02:28", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.904"}
