It is to desktop applications\nwhat Django is to web applications. Some see it as a replacement for MS\nAccess, but its tight integration with SQLAlchemy enables a vast amount of\nmore advanced features and possibilities. This tutorial style course will\nenable you to get started with your own Camelot project. We will tackle the\nhurdles met when going through the lifecycle of a desktop application First\nExample : We start our little Camelot project, have a look at the concepts and\nterminology used within Camelot. We go through the different parts of the\napplication and look at the possibilities to customize them. Declarative\nModels and Views : Then we move on by defining a relational model and use\nintrospection together with a declarative definition of our view to generate\ntable and form views. We look at the various options that can be used to\ncreate and reuse form and table definitions. Actions and Reports : Next we\u2019ll\ndive into the details of actions the user can trigger, we discuss and\nexperiment with the standard actions Camelot offers. One of those actions can\nbe the generation of a nicely formatted Word document. Advanced Model\nDefinition : Once an application grows, more advanced model definition is\nneeded. We will try out some advanced features of SQLAlchemy and see how they\ninteract with the graphical interface. Fine tuning of the GUI : Here we have a\nlook at how Qt\u2019s model-view-delegate framework works and how it is used by\nCamelot. This will enable us to fully customize the graphical interface to our\nneeds. Deployment and Users : The last step of the development process is\ngetting the application to the users. We will discuss the deployment options\nand list the things to be aware of when submitting an application to its\nusers. Q & A : Throw all Camelot questions you have in the group and try to\nresolve them together.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/x4hec861h2w?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/x4hec861h2w?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/x4hec861h2w/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4hec861h2w", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2012-07-05", "added": "2012-09-06T22:33:13", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.234"}
