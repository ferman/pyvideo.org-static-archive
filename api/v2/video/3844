I will show you how to build basic input and output circuits and introduce you to the RPi.GPIO Python module. We\u2019ll talk about how you can build a RESTful server on your Raspberry Pi to enable remote access. And finally, more ideas for hacking everyday objects around the home!\nNo prior electronics knowledge required.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-raspberry-pi-internet-of-things/pyconza2014-raspberry-pi-internet-of-things.thumbs/4%20A%20Building%20the%20Internet%20of%20Things%20with%20Raspberry%20Pi-_001350.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-raspberry-pi-internet-of-things/4%20A%20Building%20the%20Internet%20of%20Things%20with%20Raspberry%20Pi-.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-raspberry-pi-internet-of-things/4%20A%20Building%20the%20Internet%20of%20Things%20with%20Raspberry%20Pi-.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://archive.org/details/pyconza2014-raspberry-pi-internet-of-things", "whiteboard": "ia scrape", "recorded": "2014-10-02", "added": "2015-08-22T21:43:29.820", "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:29.820"}
