This talk will describe the course and student outcomes.\n\nOutline\n\nThe talk will cover the following topics: - the problems of teaching and\nlearning programming - does language make a difference? - why Python is a good\nchoice for a first language - the structure of the course - things that worked\nwell, and things that didn't - what students thought about it - impact on\nlearning Java in the second semester - changes for 2010 Note: this is a\npreliminary outline, it's likely that it will change somewhat before the\nconference.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.
