Or rather, concurrent.futures became part of the Python\nstandard library with 3.2. This style of asynchronous programming, also known\nas promises, has been around for decades but is only recently becoming popular\nin a number of languages and libraries. My presentation is meant for a Python\nprogrammer who knows nothing about futures. I\u2019ll structure it around\nprocessing web server logs, and show several ways to Python code can make more\neffective use of a multi-core machine. In some cases the multi-threaded\nexecutor is good enough, but in others the right solution is the multi-process\nexecutor. Because of the unified API, it\u2019s a one line change to switch from\none to the other. It isn\u2019t hard to write your own executor for different\ncompute models. I\u2019ll show that by developing a new one which works on top of\nthe PiCloud API. At the end I\u2019ll describe some of the more experimental work\nI\u2019m doing to use promises in a dependency graph, where certain computed\nproperties are dependent on others. Even though concurrent.futures came in\n3.2, Python 2.x users can use the API through Alex Gr\u00f6nholm\u2019s \u2018futures\u2019\nbackport.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/2Ng-UIedZMY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/2Ng-UIedZMY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Ng-UIedZMY/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ng-UIedZMY", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2012-07-06", "added": "2012-09-06T22:33:13", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.189"}
