Chun)\n\nPython is an interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language\nthat is popular for a wide range of applications, one of which is Internet\nprogramming. This tutorial introduces current Python programmers to 3-4\ndistinct areas of Internet programming, each in self-contained lectures with a\ndemonstration of code following each lecture topic. Intended Audience\n\nDevelopers familiar with Python who are interested in exploring client/server\nnetwork programming with sockets, Internet client (FTP, NNTP, e-mail),\ndevelopment and web programming.\n\nClass Outline\n\nPython is an interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language\nthat is popular for a wide range of applications, one of which is Internet\nprogramming. This tutorial introduces current Python programmers to distinct\nareas of Internet programming, each in self-contained lectures with a\ndemonstration of code following these lecture topics (each ranging from\n20-60min in length):\n\n  * Network Programming using Sockets \n  * Internet Client Programming \n  * Web/CGI Programming and Concepts \n  * Intro to Django (time-permitting) \n\nWe start at the lowest layer, where one creates communication channels\ndirectly between clients and servers using sockets then move up one level to\ndiscuss well-known Internet protocols such as FTP. Then we move up even higher\nto address the concept of web programming, including a description and purpose\nof all \"CGI\" interfaces, and finally, if there's time, to give a high-level\nquick introduction to one of the most popular Python web frameworks today,\nDjango. We'll try build and implement a simple blog in 15-20 minutes! This is\nespecially for those of you who couldn't sign up for the intro to Django\ntutorial at this PyCon which will likely be full.\n\nAbout the Instructor\n\nWESLEY J. CHUN, MSCS, is the author of Prentice Hall's bestseller, \"Core\nPython Programming\", its video training course, \"Python Fundamentals\"\n(LiveLessons DVD), and co-author of \"Python Web Development with Django\".
