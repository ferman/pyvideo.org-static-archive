I will highlight some of the best\napplications that the Django/Python community has put together, talk about\nplaces that are lacking, and talk about what these popular applications have\nin common.\n\nPart 1\n\nI have written a series of blog posts about \"Large problems\" in the community,\nand how they have been solved by members of our community with reusable apps.\nPreviously I have covered:\n\n  * Delayed Execution \n  * Search \n  * APIs \n  * Documentation \n  * Database Migrations \n\nI will update my thoughts on these issues, as well as talking about a couple\nof other new issues that I think that have been solved in a decent way. These\ninclude:\n\n  * Remote Command Execution \n  * Debugging in Development \n  * Continuous Integration \n\nPart 2\n\nIn this part I will highlight issues that are still headaches for the\nCommunity. These are places where there is a good chance for growth for third\nparty apps, and places where I have personally found some friction in my\ndevelopment. A couple examples of this are:\n\n  * Deployment \n  * Class Based Views / Thread Safety \n  * Debugging Production Environments \n\nPart 3\n\nFrom the above applications that are well done, what makes a popular reusable\napp? This won't be my thoughts, but more looking at apps that have been\nsuccessful and trying to see what they have in common. A good app and a good\nreusable app are necessarily different, and I think it will be interesting to\nlook at what traits make reusable apps popular.\n\n[Large problems posts](http://ericholscher.com/tag/largeproblems/)\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Robertlofthouse-LargeProblemsInDjangoMostlySolved109-212.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 196981339, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/djangocon-2010/52_large-problems-in-django-mostly-solved.flv", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.561"}
