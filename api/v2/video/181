Are you a more-\nor-less happy Zope developer that has the nagging feeling that much of Zope is\nunnecessary \"baggage\" on your current project? Maybe you're a Plone developer\nwho feels that Plone is unsuitable for one of your current projects because\nit's too complicated? This tutorial will present everything you need to know\nabout repoze.bfg, a small Python web framework in the spirit of Pylons. The\ngoals of repoze.bfg are simplicity, familiarity to Zope programmers (but no\nZope experience is required), execution speed, and complete, comprehensive,\nand up-to-date documentation. In this tutorial, we'll explain the core\nconcepts in repoze.bfg, then we'll lead a guided development session where we\nmake a small application using the framework. We'll also cover packaging and\ndeployment of the application. Questions are highly encouraged during the\npresentation.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ]\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-TheBigFingTutorialDevelopmentUsingTheRepozebfgWebFramew393-62.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": 1038946752, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2009/181_pycon-2009-the-big-f-ing-tutorial-development-using-the-repoze-bfg-web-framework-part-1-of-3.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.713"}
