The Grammar of Graphics primarily addresses the mapping\nof pre-built aeshetics and layouts to a particular data schema and tuples of\nmeasure variables. It has limited facility for expressing data interactivity,\nand its small set of graph types (aka \"geoms\" or glyphs) are somewhat limited\nin both their number and in the number of ways they can be combined with one\nanother.\n\nOn the flip side, most existing Python plotting frameworks adopt a \"tell me\nhow\" instead of a \"tell me what\" approach. Thus, user plotting code\ncanfrequently become mired down in what amounts to details of the rendering\nsystem.\n\nIn our talk, we will show various features of Bokeh, and talk about future\ndevelopment. We will also go into some detail about how Bokeh unifies the\ntasks of describing data mapping, building data-driven layout, and composing\nnovel visualizations using a single, multi-purpose scene and data graph.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/6_aE0kAedL0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/6_aE0kAedL0?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/6_aE0kAedL0/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/enthought/scipy_2012/Bokeh_An_Extensible_Implementation_of_the_Grammar_of_Graphics_for_Python.mp4?Signature=gBH9TWy6r8GT9YBqtkCWpOmRLPE%3D&Expires=1346382408&AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=6_aE0kAedL0", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2012-07-19", "added": "2012-08-31T16:35:34", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.092"}
