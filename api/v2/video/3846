They have been a staple of the computing world for decades: they are implemented in most programming languages, form the core of several utilities, and can be found lurking in the search-and-replace functionality of any sufficiently advanced text editor.\nDespite their usefulness, regular expressions have developed a reputation for complexity and a steep learning curve. New programmers are often warned to steer clear of them -- which is a pity, because there are some problems for which they are a quick and elegant solution.\nIn this talk I aim to demystify regular expressions for the beginner programmer, and to provide a brief guided tour of Python's re module. I hope to encourage more programmers to get to know this useful tool.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-regular-expressions/pyconza2014-regular-expressions.thumbs/9%20A%20An%20introduction%20to%20regular%20expressions%20in%20Python-_001410.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-regular-expressions/9%20A%20An%20introduction%20to%20regular%20expressions%20in%20Python-.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-regular-expressions/9%20A%20An%20introduction%20to%20regular%20expressions%20in%20Python-.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://archive.org/details/pyconza2014-regular-expressions", "whiteboard": "ia scrape", "recorded": "2014-10-03", "added": "2015-08-22T21:43:30.469", "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:30.469"}
