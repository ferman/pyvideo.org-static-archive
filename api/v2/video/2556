When did the accidents happen? What do we do now? I'm scared to drive. I will talk about purging my fears by finding the data to answer some of those questions. http://tothebeat.github.io/fatal-car-crashes/ This talk will involve PythonAnywhere, IPython, a module that's not even on PyPi (dbfpy), searching for and finding open government data, CartoDB, Google Fusion Tables, csv, and maybe Pandas. Rest assured, there will be no graphic photos.
