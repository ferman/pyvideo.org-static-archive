While Django\nenjoys one of the most thoughtful, patient, and responsive communities in the\nworld of open source web frameworks, it has a special opportunity for learning\nin Washington, D.C., where many of the most successful and voracious non-\nprofit advocacy organizations call home.\n\nThis presentation will examine some of their tactics and compare them with\nthose employed by the Django community. Among the topics covered will be\nmobilization of new troops, building and listening to diverse coalitions, and\nidentifying and reaching out to under-represented populations.\n\nThe presenter comes from a decade of experience in non-profit social justice\nactivism. Having been a Django user for 3.5 years and involved in the\ncommunity for 2, will be at only his second DjangoCon.. Freshly imported, he\nhas the perspective of a passionate newcomer rather a seasoned veteran.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/NrkopXN9sQg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/NrkopXN9sQg?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/NrkopXN9sQg/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrkopXN9sQg", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2012-09-05", "added": "2012-10-08T17:39:48", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.995"}
