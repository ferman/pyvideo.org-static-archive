However human authors are often lazy and don't fill-\nin structured metadata forms in web applications. It is however possible to\nautomate some structured knowledge extraction with simple and scalable\nstatistical learning tools implemented in python. For instance:\n\n  * guessing the language and topic of tweets and web pages \n  * analyze the sentiment (positive or negative) in consumer products reviews in blogs or customer emails \n\nThis talk will introduce the main operational steps of supervised learning:\n\n  * extracting the relevant features from text documents \n  * selecting the right machine learning algorithm to train a model for the task at hand \n  * using the trained model on previously unseen documents \n  * evaluating the predictive accuracy of the trained model \n\nWe will also demonstrate the results obtained for above tasks using the\n[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/) package and compare it to\nother implementations such as [nltk](http://nltk.org/) and the [Google\nPrediction API](http://code.google.com/apis/predict/).\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011StatisticalMachineLearningForTextClassification447.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 168176911, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/417_statistical-machine-learning-for-text-classification-with-scikit-learn.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.035"}
