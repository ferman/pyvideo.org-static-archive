Therefore we will cover asyncio and the lessions learned from using different devices in this context.\r\n\r\nSome of the devices that will be used include:\r\n\r\n - Raspberry Pi\r\n - RFXCom's RFXtrx, USB serial tranciever.\r\n - Owl CM160 electricity tracker.\r\n - Oregon scientific thermometers.\r\n - Foscam IP cameras.\r\n\r\nThis talk will also briefly cover the previous solution I used which was developed with Twisted and compare it briefly with my new code using asyncio.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/0flbR0HNWBA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/0flbR0HNWBA?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/0flbR0HNWBA/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0flbR0HNWBA", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-25", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:24.283", "updated": "2014-07-31T01:18:34.536"}
