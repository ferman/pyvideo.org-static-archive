There\u2019s been\nmany introductory talks about it, and it\u2019s time to look deeper into it: not\njust what Tornado does, but how it does it and what can we learn from it when\ndesigning our own concurrent systems. We\u2019ll cover each topic in two parts:\nfirst we\u2019ll see how to use a certain feature in our applications; then, we\u2019ll\ndig into Tornado\u2019s source code to see how it really works. How much time we\u2019ll\nspend in the \u201chow to use\u201d will depend on the audience\u2019s knowledge of Tornado.\nGetting Started: quickly get a simple Tornado application up and running.\nWe\u2019ll keep digging into, changing and poking this Application for most of the\ntalk. An Application Listens: what an Application is, how does Tornado start\nit and how does it process its requests. Application and IOLoop: we\u2019ll look at\nhow the IOLoop receives the connections from the users and passes them on to\nthe Applications. Scheduled Tasks: we\u2019ll see how to schedule tasks and how the\nIOLoop will run them. Generators: we\u2019ll learn to use generators to handle the\nresponses of our asynchronous calls, and how they work with the IOLoop.\nWebsockets: how to use them and how they work. IOStream: how do Tornado\u2019s non-\nblocking sockets work. Database: how to use non-blocking sockets to connect to\na MySQL or MongoDB database.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/4Ztq-Yz1ero?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/4Ztq-Yz1ero?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4Ztq-Yz1ero/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ztq-Yz1ero", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2012-07-04", "added": "2012-09-06T22:33:22", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.305"}
