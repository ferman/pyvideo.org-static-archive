We will start from scratch and walk through each step of\neach game discussing decision making, loops (\"for\", \"while\" and \"if\"), data\nstructures (tuple, list and dictionary) and looking at different ways to\n\"get-r-done\".\n\nYou should know a little about Python but don't have to know anything else\nabout programming (you should know how to edit and run a Python program on\nyour Operating System). Bring a computer with Python installed if you want to\nplay along.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pyohio-SoYouJustTookPython101WhatsNext456.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 105368731, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pyohio-2010/511_pyohio-2010-so-you-just-took-python-101-what-s-next.flv", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.844"}
