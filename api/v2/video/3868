My background is in Java \u2013 however more recently I have moved onto using Python, JavaScript and PHP, whilst dabbling in Go. My talk will cover:\r\n\r\n - Asynchronous programming, and the various ways it can be written in code, with reference to JavaScript and Go.\r\n - Packaging, how some languages do it better and worse than Python, and what Python can learn from them.\r\n - Unit testing in all languages is hard, but the syntactic sugar that is added can ease the pain, and make the output when your tests inevitably fail easier to read.\r\n - Syntax Shock, what brackets and semi-colons? Why are you not running \u2013 oh yes I need a semi-colon there.\r\n - Cool stuff with Magic(al) methods and Duck Typing that languages like Java would not have a hope of implementing. \r\n\r\nThis talk will highlight some of the delight I get when coming back to Python; and some of the aspects of other languages that I think would be really cool to add. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/L2JDiduangk/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 1828, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/L2JDiduangk", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-09-05", "added": "2015-09-14T05:47:16.545", "updated": "2015-09-16T04:33:59.401"}
