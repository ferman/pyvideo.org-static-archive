Many content managers are not designed with web developers in mind, and choosing the right CMS for a project, that does it's job well and assists with fast paced development, can be difficult. Everyone has a favourite out there. I'm not sure if I can call Wagtail my favourite yet, however I have found it to be a very developer-friendly system. And after unknowingly working alongside a core contributor for some time, I hadn't realised what little recognition Wagtail has as a tool, even among Django developers. My talk will thus discuss the pros and cons of the system, with a demonstration to show how easy it is to get started with using it. I will also touch on it's nature as an open-source platform and some of it's potential futures.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/glIIF-kBXf0/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 1489, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/glIIF-kBXf0", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-09-05", "added": "2015-09-14T05:45:40.206", "updated": "2015-09-16T04:33:22.783"}
