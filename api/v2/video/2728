It uses a zombie epidemic to remove the need for specific expertise regarding disease systems, relying instead on a familiar cultural reference. Students are allowed to first explore the theory of modeling, a Django front-end enabling interaction with models without the need for scientific computing skills. All the models are however implemented to be stand-alone models that can be run using SciPy or other packages, and as students grow in sophistication the open-source nature of *Zeke* allows them to develop both computational and subject-specific expertise in a stepwise fashion.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/bZv9Rw6Nh8M?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/bZv9Rw6Nh8M?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/bZv9Rw6Nh8M/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZv9Rw6Nh8M", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-09", "added": "2014-07-09T19:24:54.907", "updated": "2014-07-09T19:24:54.907"}
