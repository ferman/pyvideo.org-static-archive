This talk describes how.\n\nOutline\n\nTe Tuhi Video Game System is not a game in itself; rather it creates games\nbased on arbitrary images that it is given. To use it, you draw a picture of\nthe game you want to play, and it will give you the game that you really drew.\nThe software was originally written for an art exhibit using slightly\nspecialised hardware, but it has been released under the GPL and runs on\nordinary computers. It uses Pygame, PIL, and custom C extensions that allow it\nto evolve a playable game from a wide variety of pictures. This talk will\ndiscuss the techniques used (both refined algorithms and hacky heuristics) and\ncover topics such as image analysis, machine learning, and interface design.\nThere will be a demonstration.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Kiwipycon-DouglasBagnallTeTuhiVideoGameSystem481-359.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/kiwi-pycon-2009/111_douglas-bagnall-te-tuhi-video-game-system.flv", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.474"}
