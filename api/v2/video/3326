The seismic analyses themselves are carried out with a commercial Finite Element solver, but understanding the raw data this produces requires customised post-processing and visualisation tools. Extending the existing tools had become increasingly difficult and a decision was made to develop a new, Python-based tool-set. This comprises of a post-processing framework (\"aftershock\") which includes an an embedded Python interpreter, and a plotting package (\"afterplot\") based on numpy and matplotlib.\r\n\r\nThe new tool-set had to be significantly more flexible and easier to maintain than the existing code-base, while allowing the majority of development to be carried out by engineers with little training in software development. The resulting architecture will be described with a focus on exploring how the design drivers were met and the successes and challenges arising from the choices made.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "youtube", "embed": "<iframe type='text/html' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/BiqPbiWv2hY' width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'/>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BiqPbiWv2hY/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiqPbiWv2hY", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-10-22", "added": "2014-11-05T22:41:03.354", "updated": "2014-11-05T22:41:03.354"}
