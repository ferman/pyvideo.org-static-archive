It wasn't until the release\nof PyPy 1.18 that I actually ran some existing production python code under\nit. The perceived performance improvement of this exercise inspired me to\nimplement a more scientific method for comparing the runtime performance of\nCPython and PyPy running various Python production code sets that we use in\nthe company I work for. This presentation will discuss the results of this\ncomparison and the positives and negatives with utilising PyPy in production.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/KN9eHa2cXNQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/KN9eHa2cXNQ?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/KN9eHa2cXNQ/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN9eHa2cXNQ", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2012-08-22", "added": "2013-01-15T14:29:51", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.030"}
