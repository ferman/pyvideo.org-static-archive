Even a small cluster will happily accept and store thousands of messages per second, and make them available to consumers with low latency.\r\n\r\nKafka was chosen as the solution to our publish-subscribe infrastructure at [Takealot.com](http://www.takealot.com/). It supports our event-driven systems on the website, in the warehouses and in the office, as well as our analytics and machine learning projects.\r\n\r\nThis talk will\r\n\r\n * introduce the basic Kafka principles that make things work,\r\n * outline how Kafka fits in with the rest of our architecture,\r\n * cover some of the practicalities of building Python-based Kafka services,\r\n * compare the two main Python libraries for Kafka, namely [kafka-python](https://github.com/mumrah/kafka-python) and [pykafka](https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka),\r\n * demonstrate some practical applications at Takealot.com.\r\n\r\nJoin in if you are interested in scalable distributed infrastructure.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b8Cj5-LieH0/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 2387, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/b8Cj5-LieH0", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-10-01", "added": "2015-09-30T02:44:04.605", "updated": "2015-10-10T14:30:41.896"}
