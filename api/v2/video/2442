Pyramid is a 'non-opinionated' web framework and therefore enables you to pick-and-choose what packages you'd like to use in your software stack, making it very flexible and easy to develop your custom application with. I'll go through some of the features of Pyramid that we're using in our app with code examples. I'll also briefly cover some of the other free web services we're using in our app and how these all fit together with the Pyramid-based app.\r\n\r\n[1] http://www.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/about\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/tim-knapp-how-to-build-a-0-dollars-saas-app-with-pyramid-and-gae", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/keVHrgqNSt4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/keVHrgqNSt4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/keVHrgqNSt4/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keVHrgqNSt4", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2013-09-14", "added": "2013-10-19T19:58:53", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.081"}
