We all know how useless and frustrating out-of-date or just plain incorrect documentation is. In this talk I'd like to demonstrate how Python can help make writing documentation, keeping it up-to-date and verifying its validity. It can be surprising what happens when other people discover your little-but-well-documented API.\nPython has several built-in concepts and standard tools to help making this easier, such as docstrings, help(), Sphinx, Sphinx plugins, Doctests and generating documentation off tests themselves.\nI'll focus on not only using Sphinx as a tool, but also on how to structure your application/library/tool so as to make writing accurate documentation as simple as possible.", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful.thumbs/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-_000150.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://archive.org/details/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful", "whiteboard": "ia scrape", "recorded": "2014-10-03", "added": "2015-08-22T21:43:28.154", "updated": "2015-08-22T21:43:28.154"}
