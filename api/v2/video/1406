By trading it for nose, a testing\nframework popular in the wider Python community, we can reduce boilerplate,\nboost performance, and improve testing UI, with only a few lines of setting\nchanges. Re-use your test DBs, integrate with Jenkins, split your suite into\npieces, and more.\n\n", "description": "  * Why nose?\n    * Pain points with standard Django testing\n    * Extensibility without writing custom, uncombineable testrunner subclasses\n    * Rich ecosystem of helpful plugins\n  * django-nose\n    * Testing just your apps, not all the random installed stuff\n    * Test-selection tricks: running just failed tests, running a module, etc.\n    * Killing the boilerplate:\n      * No more imports into **init**\n      * No more class name collisions and accidental shadowing\n      * With all this freedom, how best should you organize your tests?\n    * Going 4 times faster with fixture bundling\n      * Troubleshooting\n      * Fixtures are evil\n      * Where do I put the factories?\n    * Speeding startup with test DB reuse\n    * Writing faster TransactionTestCases with hygienic base classes\n      * Background on Django's handling of TransactionTestCases\n      * How to improve matters\n    * Test-only models: what's the best practice?\n  * nose-progressive\n    * Dots considered harmful.
