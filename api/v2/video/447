These modules and techniques\nprovide the foundation for developer's tools such as autocompletion IDE's,\ncode analysis tools, test runners, profilers, and so on.\n\nI'll delve into a number of the common techniques used to write Python-Aware\nPython. Each has its area of applicability and its strengths and weaknesses.\nI'll demonstrate small samples that show how those techniques underlie the\ntools we all know and love.\n\nThe world of Python tools is ready for new exploration. This talk will give\nyou the foundation you need to write the next great Python-aware application.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011PythonAwarePython331.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 222244649, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/447_python-aware-python.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:28.016"}
