You need to know everything, they don't.\r\n\r\nThe odds aren't in your favour. You're eventually going to get hacked.\r\n\r\nThat's the bad news. But if you stop thinking about a security compromise as \"that thing you close your eyes and hope never happens\", and instead start thinking about it as an inevitability, then you can start making better security decisions.\r\n\r\n\"If they compromise my web servers, how do I protect my application servers?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they break my application server code, how can I prevent them from gaining a foothold on my infrastructure?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they poison my web-site with cross-site scripting, how do I find out before my users get hurt?\"\r\n\r\nIn short: \"If I'm going to get hacked, how do I make it hurt less?\"\r\n\r\nThis is a talk about defence in depth.\r\n\r\nBuilding a secure system isn't about luck, it\u2019s about planning.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/dcDrsKX2ULU/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 2102, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/dcDrsKX2ULU", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-09-06", "added": "2015-09-14T05:46:52.785", "updated": "2015-09-16T04:33:53.215"}
