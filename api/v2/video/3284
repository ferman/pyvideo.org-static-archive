As evidence of its immaturity as a discipline, consider how frequently the same problems arise in the practice of writing a programme, and how these problems are unaccompanied by widely-disseminated conceptualisations or a commonly agreed-upon pathology or even a well-defined guiding philosophy and epistemology. In other words, we keep running into the same problems, and we often lack even a basis for discussing them (much less avoiding them)!", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "youtube", "embed": "<iframe type='text/html' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/2GA4y6_I7b4' width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'/>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GA4y6_I7b4/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GA4y6_I7b4", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-09-16", "added": "2014-10-26T18:22:33.401", "updated": "2014-10-26T18:22:33.401"}
