Instead of using fast\r\nmodeling tools, you need to know more about the essential things in modeling:\r\n\r\n- What is a model ? \r\n- How models solve your problems ?\r\n- What is the connection between models and data ?\r\n- What is the important data ? important model ?\r\n\r\nI deeply believe ... The more the connection between models and data you know, the deeper the problem you can solve.\r\n\r\nOutline:\r\nWhat is Modeling ?  \r\nData, Model, Evaluators  \r\nDirect Problem: Data + Evaluators \u2192 Model  \r\nInverse Problem: Data + Models \u2192 Evaluator  \r\nHacking Models with Metric Learning  \r\nData as a Model & Model as a Data  \r\nDuality between Dimension Reduction and Clustering  \r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "youtube", "embed": "<iframe type='text/html' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/PznPp-BbwyU' width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'/>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PznPp-BbwyU/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PznPp-BbwyU", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-06-26", "added": "2014-10-26T00:13:23.260", "updated": "2014-10-26T17:38:00.419"}
