The talk will cover\nbasic concepts, a brief walkthrough of some more advanced features, and how\nTexas A&M is using MongoDB and Python to solve some large data problems.\n\n", "description": "In the last month, we've started an effort to aggregate our logs so we can do\nsome real-time, holistic log analysis. Among other things, we are tracking\nfailed logins across all points of entry, identifying possibly compromised\naccounts (simultaneous logins from multiple IPs, geographically disparate\nlogins), and identifying high-volume mailers across multiple mail relays. The\ntalk will include an introduction to MongoDB (NoSQL, data structures,\nquerying, indexing, differences from relational databases, etc); some\nimportant performance and reliability features like its support for replica\nsets, sharding, and map/reduce; and some very cool features like GridFS and\ngeospatial indexing. All of this, with the exception of database\nconfiguration, will be demoed with MongoDB's python client.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Nextdayvideo-GettingStartedWithPyMongo126-736.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 243851181, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pytexas-2011/559_getting-started-with-pymongo.m4v", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.482"}
