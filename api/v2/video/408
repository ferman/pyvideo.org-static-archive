That brilliance\nshines in code and peer-to-peer conversation. But how do you display your\nskills to a non-programmer? How do you impress management and human resources?\nWhat do you need to do (and not do) to successfully navigate the hiring\nprocess and land the job?\n\nAbstract\n\nImaginary Landscape has been interviewing, hiring and not hiring Python talent\nsince 1999. Throughout these many years, there have been good candidates, bad\ncandidates and downright ugly candidates. This talk will use actual\ncorrespondence and examples to demonstrate what can separate you from the\ncrowd and what can separate you from consideration. Imaginary Landscape non-\ntechnical Managing Partner Brian Moloney will lead the session by describing\nhow he evaluates potential hires and what goes through his mind while speaking\nwith potential Python candidates. Attendees will take away a specific set of\nguidelines for mastering the non-technical aspects of the recruiting process.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: There are problems with the audio for the first 5 minutes.]\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011GettingTheJobTheDosAndDontsOfLandingAPython220.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 163142762, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/408_getting-the-job-the-do-s-and-don-ts-of-landing-a-python-job.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-03-11", "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.977"}
