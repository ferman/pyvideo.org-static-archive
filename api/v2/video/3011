All this time we were using Apache+nginx for hosting this projects. In this talk I will explain why we decided to switch all our projects from Apache+nginx to uWSGI+nginx and how we did that.", "description": "The talk will start from describing the setup we had for the last 7 years, i.e. Apache with mod_wsgi for Python projects and mod_php4/5 for PHP projects + nginx. I will explain why we used this setup for so long time, what problems we faced with this setup and what solutions we tried to solve them before switching to uWSGI.\r\n\r\nThen I will tell about uWSGI, what it is, how it works and what features it has. I will show the comparison of configuration files, how simple it is to configure uWSGI compared to Apache.\r\n\r\nLastly I will explain how we managed to switch all our 800+ projects developed over the years in 2 different languages with 2 major versions changed (PHP4/5 and Python2/3), how this switch simplified our development and administration of this projects, the improvements we got in memory management and other areas.\r\n\r\nOf course I will concentrate mainly on our Python projects because it is EuroPython after all and not EuroPHP ;-)", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/e8Fz3bxPFC4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/e8Fz3bxPFC4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e8Fz3bxPFC4/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Fz3bxPFC4", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-23", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:32.159", "updated": "2014-08-01T07:51:32.390"}
