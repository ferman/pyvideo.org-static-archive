Numerous tools are provided for constructing finite-element meshes from microstructural images, and for implementing material properties from a very broad class which includes elasticity, chemical and thermal diffusion, and electrostatics. The software can be operated either as an interactive, GUI-driven application, as a scripted command-line tool, or as a supporting library, providing useful access to users of varying levels of expertise. At every level, the user-interface objects are intended to be familiar to the materials-science user.\r\n\r\nThe modular object-oriented design of the code, and the strategy of separating the finite-element infrastructure from the material constitutive rules proved itself in implementing the new solid-mechanics capabilities.\r\n\r\nDevelopment on a fully-3D version of the code has also made significant progress, overcoming several challenges associated with user-interface issues. A nontrivial, solved 3D problem will be presented.\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/VzXiPmR_wQk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/VzXiPmR_wQk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/VzXiPmR_wQk/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzXiPmR_wQk", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-13", "added": "2014-07-15T22:45:41.180", "updated": "2014-07-16T14:14:55.980"}
