Many of us find that, just to keep doing our job, we have\nunderstand JavaScript better. This tutorial, which was also given at\nEuroPython 2009, 2010 and 2011, provides an introduction to JavaScript that\nemphasises the similarities and differences between Python and JavaScript. It\nhas a focus on the concepts underlying JavaScript, and in particular the\nobject model and the lack of built-in classes. It also covers quite a few\nJavaScript gotchas and other traps for the unwary. This course is suitable for\nthose who are Beginners or better in Python. Previous JavaScript knowledge is\nnot required, but would helpful. This course was prepared and previously\ndelivered by Jonathan Fine. I was assisting in the course in 2010 as a helper\nand worked a little on improving the materials during the sprints. I intend to\nimprove the materials further and bring them up to date with recent\ndevelopments in the JavaScript world, and then deliver the tutorial, because\nJonathan will not be attending the conference this year.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/OyavJFwEZFo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/OyavJFwEZFo?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/OyavJFwEZFo/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyavJFwEZFo", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2012-07-05", "added": "2012-09-06T22:33:14", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.245"}
