These 'digital footprints' provide new means to understand how individuals utilize the places and spaces of urban environments. We present a light-weight framework for real-time event detection in a city based on existing SciPy libraries and real-time Twitter streams.", "description": "In this paper, we utilize real-time 'social information sources' to automatically detect important events at the urban scale. The goal is to provide city planners and others with information on *what* is going on, and *when* and *where* it is happening. Traditionally, this type of analysis would require a large investment in heavy-duty computing infrastructure, however, we suggest that a focus on real-time analytics in a lightweight streaming framework is the most logical step forward.\r\n\r\nUsing online Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) from the [`gensim`][gensim] Python package, we extract 'topics' from tweets in an online training fashion. To maintain real-time relevance, the topic model is continually updated, and depending on parameterization, can 'forget' past topics. Based on a set of learned topics, a grid of spatially located tweets for each identified topic is generated using standard `numpy` and `scipy.spatial` functionality. Using an efficient streaming algorithm for approximating 2D kernel density estimation (KDE), locations with the highest density of tweets on a particular topic are located. Locations are semantically labeled using the learned topics, based on the assumption that events can be directly tied to a particularly popular topic at a particular location.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate real time visualization of results, we utilize the [`pico`][pico] Python/Javascript library as a real-time bridge between server-side Python analysis and client-side Javascript visualization. This enables fast, responsive interactivity of computationally intensive tasks. Additionally, since `pico` allows streaming data from Python to Javascript, updates to the web-interface are sent and consumed as needed, such that only significant changes in an event's status, or the introduction of a new event, will cause updates to the visualizations. Finally, because all models, data structures, and outputs on the server side are pickle-able Python objects, this entire framework is small enough to be deployed on almost any server with Python installed.\r\n\r\n[pico]: https://github.com/fergalwalsh/pico\r\n[gensim]: https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/iT_QmeJsBhE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/iT_QmeJsBhE?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/iT_QmeJsBhE/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT_QmeJsBhE", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-14", "added": "2014-07-15T22:45:38.627", "updated": "2014-07-15T23:07:49.753"}
