We have a huge user community, but the vast\nmajority of users never make the leap and become contributors. This talk will\nwalk you through the process of making the transition from Django user, to\nDjango Project contributor.\n\n", "description": "Django needs you! No -- seriously -- Django is a volunteer project, and the\nability of Django to continue to improve is entirely controlled by the time\nand dedication people like you are willing to put into making Django better.\n\nHowever, it's not just a matter of sitting down and writing code. If you don't\nhave a plan for how you're going to engage with the rest of the community,\nit's very easy to put in a lot of effort, and then have that effort go\nentirely to waste. This talk will give you some tips on how to engage the\ncommunity so that you can see your effort turn into progress, and not just be\nlost in a mailing list.\n\nGetting involved doesn't just mean contributing code, either. There are lots\nof other ways that you can be a valuable member of the community, and this\ntalk will give you several suggestions for how your talents could be used to\nimprove the entire Django ecosystem.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/grGIl9gP-iY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/grGIl9gP-iY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/grGIl9gP-iY/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grGIl9gP-iY", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2012-09-06", "added": "2012-10-08T17:39:53", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:26.976"}
