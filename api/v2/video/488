Perhaps you've thought how\nnice it would be to make a Linux USB driver for some Windows-only device, or\nyou've got something proprietary you would like to reverse-engineer and\nrepurpose for your next big scheme. We know Python can do pretty much anything\ninside the computer--but how does a software person enter the world of\ncircuits? And once you have some circuits, how can you bring the data back\ninto your box? Bridging the worlds of hardware and software, I will show the\npower of PyUSB and Pyserial to pwn some sweet hardware and charm it over the\nUSB port. From my own trials and tribulations building and hacking real\ndevices, from a simple HID-class USB missile launcher to the custom protocol\nused in a complex biomedical data acquisition system, you will learn about USB\npacket sniffing, rapid-prototyping device drivers in python, and deciphering\ncircuit boards and data sheets for fun & profit. I aim to leave you armed and\nready to take on hardware of your own.\n\n", "description": "", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Gloriajw-GoGoGadgetPython896-758.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 209351340, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2011/488_pygotham-2011-go-go-gadget-python.ogv", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2011/488_pygotham-2011-go-go-gadget-python.m4v", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.809"}
