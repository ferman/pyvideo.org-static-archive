All of that except Nginx are written in Python. Systemd is a new init process coming.\r\n\r\n* Circus is a process and socket manager, and gives a nice way to scale processes. \r\n* Chaussette WSGI server works well with Circus, as Circus can pass the socket to it.\r\n* Django-environ it's a library that parses environment variables or files with key-value pairs. Environment variables are used on some PaaS, but the file support I find very useful.\r\n* Fabric is a framework for writing system commands to be run on remote hosts, and is great for automating system administration.\r\n* Systemd is a new \"init\" process for Linux and offers some interesting possibilities for hosting Python webapps.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AxTeVemFBkQ/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 1774, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/AxTeVemFBkQ", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-09-05", "added": "2015-09-14T05:45:54.344", "updated": "2015-09-16T04:33:33.555"}
