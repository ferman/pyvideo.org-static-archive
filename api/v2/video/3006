The strength of TM is to enable a novel use of multithreading, inheritently safe, and not limited to special use cases like other approaches. This talk will focus on how it works under the hood.", "description": "PyPy is a fast alternative Python implementation.  Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a current academic research topic.  Put the two together --brew for a couple of years-- and we get a version of PyPy that runs on multiple cores, without the infamous Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\r\n\r\nThe current research is based on a recent new insight that promises to give really good performance.  The speed of STM is generally measured by two factors: the ability to scale with the number of CPUs, and the amount of overhead when compared with other approaches in a single CPU (in this case, with the regular PyPy with the GIL).  Scaling is not really a problem here, but single-CPU performance is --or used to be. This new approach gives a single-threaded overhead that should be very low, maybe 20%, which would definitely be news for STM systems.  Right now (February 2014) we are still implementing it, so we cannot give final numbers yet, but early results on a small interpreter for a custom language are around 15%.  This looks like a deal-changer for STM.\r\n\r\nIn the talk, I will describe our progress, hopefully along with real numbers and demos.  I will then dive under the hood of PyPy to give an idea about how it works.  I will conclude with a picture of how the future of multi-threaded programming might looks like, for high-level languages like Python.  I will also mention CPython: how hard (or not) it would be to change the CPython source code to use the same approach.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/yMyMEsOi8oY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/yMyMEsOi8oY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/yMyMEsOi8oY/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMyMEsOi8oY", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-23", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:31.648", "updated": "2014-08-02T09:49:53.321"}
