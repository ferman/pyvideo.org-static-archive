However, by looking at the\nsuccesses and challenges faced by other CMSes and collections of apps such as\nPinax, we have taken the philosophy a stage futher.\n\nRather than being a collection of Django apps, we have constructed GLAMkit as\na collection of optional and reusable Django 'toolkits' for implementing\ncommon features. We leave the implementation details - the things that Django\nalready does brilliantly - to the application developers themselves.\n\nIn this talk, we will present the history of GLAMkit's development, with\nparticular focus on how our approach to reusability came about, and some\nexamples of that approach.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pyconau-GLAMkitABetterFasterStrongerWayToWriteReusableDjangoCo180.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-au-2010/472_pyconau-2010-glamkit-a-harder-better-faster-stronger-way-to-write-reusable-django-code.flv", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.776"}
