Take your command-line programs to the next level!", "description": "Python is a great language for writing command-line tools - which is why so much of Linux is secretly written in Python these days. Unfortunately, what starts as a simple script can quickly get out of hand as more features are added and more people start using it!\r\n\r\nThe talk will consist of a tour through various useful libraries and practical code showing how each can be used, and include advice on how to best structure simple and complex command-line tools.\r\n\r\nThings to consider when writing command-line apps:\r\n\r\n* Single-file vs Multiple-file\r\n* Standard library only vs. 3rd party requirements\r\n* Installation - setup.py vs. native packaging\r\n\r\nThe different parts of a command-line program:\r\n\r\n* Option Parsing:\r\n    * Libraries: getopt, optparse, argparse, docopt\r\n    * Sub-commands\r\n* Configuration:\r\n    * Formats: Ini file, JSON, YAML\r\n    * Where should it be stored (cross-platform);\r\n    * Having multiple configuration files, and allowing user config to override global config\r\n* Output:\r\n    * Colour - colorama\r\n    * Formatting output for the user\r\n    * Formatting output for other programs\r\n    * How do you know when your output is being piped to another program?\r\n    * Managing logging and verbosity\r\n* Managing streamed input\r\n* Exit values: What are the conventions?\r\n* Interactive apps - REPL\r\n* Structuring a bunch of programs/commands around a shared codebase.\r\n* Command-line frameworks: clint, compago & cliff\r\n* Testing command-line apps\r\n* Writing command-line tools in Python 3 vs Python 2", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/gR73nLbbgqY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/gR73nLbbgqY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gR73nLbbgqY/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR73nLbbgqY", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2014-07-24", "added": "2014-07-31T00:46:27.450", "updated": "2014-07-31T23:12:49.800"}
