When there is an issue with the boiler, they need to be able to get as much data about that specific boiler as quickly as possible. Thankfully, the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) have published databases online with various data on publicly registered boilers and burners. In this talk, I will discuss the methods I have used to scrape these boiler and burner data from the web using python libraries.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SDKLLQwK7vA/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": 1637, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "http://64966d3674e0a64d8f4a-47c94b14ef8e1f83d5390cdb0629c6ed.r53.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2015/3793_Collecting_and_Organizing_Boiler_Data_From_Various.mp4", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/SDKLLQwK7vA", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2015-08-16", "added": "2015-08-10T15:48:23.733", "updated": "2015-08-18T09:47:58.868"}
