While the\nproject will be walking through various third-party Django apps, the\nexperiences and conclusions are drawn from joining a large, existing Django\nproject which lacked documentation.\n\nAbstract\n\nIn the broadest sense, this talk is on how to read code. More than this, it is\na series of methods and practices which one can follow to get up to speed on a\nnew codebase. The subject of this talk will be open-sourced Django projects,\nbut many of the experiences which fuel this talk will be based on joining a\nnew team. It will cover tracing execution paths, finding the more interesting\nportions of a codebase, as well as how to address any issues you may have\nfound in it.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Robertlofthouse-LearningANewCodebase752.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 197289650, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/djangocon-2010/40_learning-a-new-codebase.flv", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.563"}
