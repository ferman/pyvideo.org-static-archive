This talk will be illustrated by the example of two challenges in which I took part, both times in teams that placed second. The first of these challenges was in toxicogenetics (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1734172), aiming at predicting the toxicity of a chemical on a cell line. The second (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1761567) was aimed at predicting the response of patients to rhematoid arthritis treatment.", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "youtube", "embed": "<iframe type='text/html' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/IpK9GeYs_KA' width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='true'/>", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IpK9GeYs_KA/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpK9GeYs_KA", "whiteboard": "needs editing", "recorded": "2015-04-13", "added": "2015-04-22T17:59:38.542", "updated": "2015-04-22T17:59:38.542"}
