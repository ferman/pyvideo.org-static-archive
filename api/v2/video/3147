There's an opportunity there to solve problems automatically rather than through human input. Member Eric Stein designed a Python / OpenCV based application (lidless) to monitor four video cameras in the space and offer a REST API, a web front end with historical graphs, and an IRC bot in the IRC channel to relay information about how busy the space is.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a short demo of the application accompanied by motivations and high level archtechture breakdown. Following the demo/archtechture I'll dive into the parts of the code that people are most interested in hearing about with Q&A.\r\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "", "embed": "<embed src=\"//www.youtube.com/v/GiUPv2Q01lw?hl=en_US&amp;version=3&amp;rel=0\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed>", "thumbnail_url": "", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": "", "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": "", "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiUPv2Q01lw", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-11-10", "added": "2014-09-07T20:38:25.523", "updated": "2014-09-07T20:45:54.225"}
