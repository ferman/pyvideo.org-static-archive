ParaView\u2019s core algorithms are implemented in C/C++ but\nall its major functionality can be scripted from python with ease. I\u2019ll give a\nshort introduction to AstroViz, a parallel visualization tool for\nastrophysical simulations implemented as an opensource plugin to ParaView,\nwhich I have been lead developer on since 2009. The focus of the talk will be\non driving ParaView from within python however, both general out of the box\nuse and customized extensions.\n\nI also have access to several parallel supercomputers so if there\u2019s a huge\ndataset we as a crowd would like to tackle visualizing during the course of\nthe week that would be fun project. The end of the talk will be a short\nbrainstorm of cool applications of analysis and visualization of large scale\ndatasets.\n\n[http://www.paraview.org/](http://www.paraview.org/)\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "embed": "<object width=\"640\" height=\"390\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://youtube.com/v/4fHnMecFIyw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://youtube.com/v/4fHnMecFIyw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object>", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4fHnMecFIyw/hqdefault.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": null, "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fHnMecFIyw", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": "2011-07-13", "added": "2012-08-30T21:02:28", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:27.907"}
