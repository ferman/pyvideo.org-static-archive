Much like Django, DSFs (domain specific frameworks)\nprovide more structure and have more opinion than utility libraries, but\nremain focused on providing developer instead of end-user level functionality.\nUnlike Django, DSFs focus on solving a very specific set of specific problems.\n\nThis talk will provide an overview of some of the existing DSFs in the\nPython/Django world, review some of the common patterns used within them, and\nthen explore some things which can be done to make it easier for people to\ncreate and maintain DSFs. Two of the DSFs to be discussed include Celery and\nImageKit. Some of the patterns to be reviewed include registration, backends,\nand framework integration/independence. Finally, the future facing discussion\nwill explore possible tools to make DSF building easier and steps general\npurpose frameworks (Django) can take to ease integration.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Robertlofthouse-DomainSpecificFrameworksWhyTheyRockAndWhatCanWeDoTo103-637.jpg", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 179779653, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/djangocon-2010/54_domain-specific-frameworks-why-they-rock-and-what-can-we-do-to-get-more-of-them.flv", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.471"}
