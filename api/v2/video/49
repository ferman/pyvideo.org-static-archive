They are often rewritten from scratch just to make small changes\nto functionality.\n\nIf you use class-based views, code can be reused by inheriting from more\nabstract views. They are provided with many reusable applications, but all\nimplemented in slightly different ways. It has been suggested a set of views\nbe supplied with Django to standardise the API.\n\nI will present some of the advantages and disadvantages of using class-based\nviews, and how they can help you develop more flexible applications in less\ntime.\n\n", "quality_notes": "", "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "embed": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Robertlofthouse-AlternativeViews292.png", "duration": null, "video_ogv_length": 117921388, "video_ogv_url": null, "video_ogv_download_only": false, "video_mp4_length": null, "video_mp4_url": null, "video_mp4_download_only": false, "video_webm_length": null, "video_webm_url": null, "video_webm_download_only": false, "video_flv_length": null, "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/djangocon-2010/49_alternative-views.flv", "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "whiteboard": "", "recorded": null, "added": "2012-02-23T04:20:00", "updated": "2014-04-08T20:28:25.378"}
