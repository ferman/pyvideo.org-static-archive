Building your own kind of dictionary

Presented by W. Matthew Wilson

My talk is based on a project that seemed very simple at first. I wanted an
object like the regular python dictionary, but with a few small tweaks:

  * values for some keys should be restricted to elements of a set 
  * values for some keys should be restricted to instances of a type 

For example, pretend I want a dictionary called favorites, and I want the
value for the "color" key to be any instance of my Color class. Meanwhile, for
the "movie" key, I want to make sure that the value belongs to my set of
movies.

In the talk, I'll walk through how I used tests to validate my different
implementations until I came up with a winner.

Unlike my talk last year on metaclass tomfoolery, and the year before that on
fun with decorators (and decorator factories) I'm hoping to make this talk
straightforward and friendly to beginning programmers.

You'll see:

  * how I use tests to solve a real-world problem 
  * a few little gotchas with the super keyword 
  * a little about how python works under the hood.

Code With Style

Presented by Clayton Parker

Six Feet Up's senior developer Clayton Parker will lead you on a journey to
become a Python Zen master. Your code should be as fashionable as it is
functional. To quote the Zen of Python, "Beautiful is better than ugly". This
talk will teach you about the Python style guide and why it is important. The
talk will show you examples of well written Python and how to analyze your
current code to make Guido proud.

Controlling UNIX Processes using Supervisor

Presented by Calvin Hendryx-Parker

Supervisor is a Python daemon that can control arbitrary processes in a UNIX-
like environment. It features a client/server model of control that can easily
be extended. This talk will cover the configuration and setup of Supervisor.
It will also cover how to extend Supervisor and take advantage of its XML-RPC
interface and ability to react to events that it generates.

Genetic Programming in Python

Presented by Eric Floehr

Did you know you can create and evolve programs that find solutions to
problems? This talk walks through how to use Genetic Programming (GP) as a
tool to discover solutions to hard problems, when to use GP, how best to set
up the GP environment, and how to interpret the results.

Getting to know MongoDB using Python and IronPython

Presented by Sam Corder

Is your RDBMS not coping with the load anymore and can't be scaled out any
further? Are you designing the next big thing and know your RDBMS won't be
able to handle it? Are you tired of shoe-horning a data model into where it
doesn't belong? Are you just curious what this thing called MongoDB is? In
this session you will explore a popular alternative to the RDBMS called Mongo
from one who has battled with BSON to write the original .Net driver. You'll
learn basics of schema design, document manipulation, several ways to get at
your data, something odd called map/reduce and all from the comfort of Python
and the slightly uncomfortable IronPython.

Implementation of a Numerical Simulation in Python

Presented by Jeffrey B. Armstrong

The Python programming language is well suited for numerical computation under
a variety of circumstances. Python offers advantages over competing free and
commercial technologies, including price, functionality, and maintainability.
Specifically, the combination of mature numerical libraries and liberal
licensing allow complex simulations to be coded with ease and to be made
available to nearly all interested parties. !NumPy/!SciPy, database access,
networking, and optimization techniques are examined in detail with respect to
numerical computation. A practical example involving an aerothermal commercial
turbofan aircraft engine simulation showcases these advantages. An aircraft
engine is broken down into discrete stages, including compressors, turbines,
and other flow-related components. Commonalities between components, such as
rotation and the presence of inlet and exit conditions, map cleanly to the
object-oriented nature of Python. Based on simulation needs and hardware
availability, Python allows for the parallel computation of simulations
without the expense and complexity of commercial parallelization packages.

Log Analysis with Python

Presented by Scott McCarty

Log analysis is something that every programmer and systems adminstrator must
do sometimes. This talk will be an introduction to the concepts of pattern
recognition, artificial ignorance, word counting, stopword lists, and command
line graphing. It is based on a pythonic implementation of these techniques
called petit and will delve into several use cases and show how using these
techniques can help you save time when analyzing logs with python.

Making it go faster

Presented by W. Matthew Wilson

An introduction to profiling python code.

I'll use cProfile, pstats, and RunSnakeRun to find where code is getting
bogged down in a real-world example. I'll measure the run-time cost with
timeit, refactor, and measure it again.

Finally, I'll talk about the limits of python optimization and show how to
replace python code with C.

Processing Large Datasets with Hadoop and Python

Presented by William McVey

This talk will explore how Hadoop along with Python can be used to process
large datasets. An overview of the Apache Hadoop project will be given. The
map/reduce concept will be introduced and some methods of coding the data
processing routines in python will be explored. The talk will use real world
examples to illustrate how this approach can be used to parallelize
computationally expensive operations across multiple cluster nodes effectively
using python.

The course will assume familiarity with the Python language during the demos,
but will not actually require a deep knowledge of python to understand the
concepts introduced.

Project Management 101

Presented by James Bonanno

Python is employed for a general purpose project management tool. Contrasted
to tools like Sphinx which focus on documenting a software project, this
framework is intended for general purpose project management, with a specific
application into engineering projects. Intermediate uses of Python are
employed, as well as the Web.py framework, Sphinx documentation tool and the
Mako template system. The author has used this tool to create internal
commercial applications of the project management software.

Python 101 for the .NET Developer

Presented by Sarah Dutkiewicz

The first part of the session will cover the basics of Python - its history,
how its data structures compare to those we're familiar with in the primary
.NET languages, its strong and weak points, who's using it, and why you as a
developer - both generally speaking and as a .NET developer - should care
about Python. The second part of the session will get into the demos -
starting with some basic Python scripts and getting into IronPython scripts,
if time allows. By the end of this session, you'll have an idea of what Python
is, why you should know it as a developer and specifically as a .NET
developer, and how to get setup and write a basic app in both Python and
IronPython.

Python and Entrepeneurship

Featuring Eric Floehr, Nick Albright, Matt Wilson, Austin Godber, James
Bonanno

One of the strengths of dynamic languages is rapid development and quick
results. Python has been used by a number of Ohio small businesses, from
supporting back-office operations to being the language the company's products
are built on. This panel discussion will talk about the opportunities and
challenges in using Python to build a business on, as well as a discussion on
starting, running, and growing a technology-based business.

So You Just Took "Python 101" -- What's Next?

Presented by Greg Lindstrom

In this class we will develop, step-by-step and as a class, two simple games,
Hi/Low and Hangman. We will start from scratch and walk through each step of
each game discussing decision making, loops ("for", "while" and "if"), data
structures (tuple, list and dictionary) and looking at different ways to
"get-r-done".

You should know a little about Python but don't have to know anything else
about programming (you should know how to edit and run a Python program on
your Operating System). Bring a computer with Python installed if you want to
play along.
