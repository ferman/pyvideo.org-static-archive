How to Test the Hard Stuff

Presented by Stephan Richter

Stephan will cover testing network-driven components, RDB stubbing, test setup
layering and stuff like that. Recently he used manuel to do this sort of
testing by simulating CLIs and Shell access in a doctest-style test, so he may
cover that as well.

Bring your testing challenges and the impossible to automate projects that
haunt you at night, we'll see what Stephan can do with them.

Testing, Where Do I Start?

Presented by Marshall Weir

Marshall will cover basic unit test concepts and quickly move to making your
tests motivating, easy to run and adding testing to an existing project. He's
aiming squarely at developers who have projects they want to use testing for,
but don't know where to get started.

Have you wanted to become test-infected but couldn't find the start of the
thread to pull? Marshall will help.
