It's inevitable that online communities will change, and that we'll remember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately reflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of articles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is unworthy. We'll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just a \"pip install\" away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ned Jackson Lovely</dc:creator><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3321/enough-machine-learning-make-hacker-news-readable-</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI2jidR4RsI" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xI2jidR4RsI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Weather of The Century</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3308/weather-of-the-century</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The weather is everywhere and always. That makes for a lot of data. This talk will walk you through how you can use MongoDB to store and analyze worldwide weather data from the entire 20th century in a graphical application. You'll learn how to ask and answer questions about capacity planning and scaling for both real-time and ad-hoc operations when dealing with huge datasets.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">J.

While Tolkien had friends who could devise ingenious ways to critique his work without sounding critical, he had others whose remarks were merciless and direct — to the point that Tolkien simply stopped sharing new chapters as he wrote The Lord of the Rings. As programmers we share many of the struggles of writers and artists, and we often react just as badly to critique of our code. From Tolkien’s experience we will draw lessons about how to make critique generous instead of damaging, and actionable instead of personal.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brandon Rhodes</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3316/how-to-shut-down-tolkien</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVlqBxpCG24" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qVlqBxpCG24/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Architectural evolution in startups</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3311/architectural-evolution-in-startups</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

Matt's obsession with Python's rich comparison methods started about 6 years ago with a gnarly bug and some bad assumptions. A few long nights and a lot of reading later, the docs corrected my assumption:

There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false.
Mind == blown and mind != blown. In Getting Rich with Comparison Methods we'll start by learning how to avoid common and costly bugs in your rich comparison methods, learn a bit about which methods are executed in comparisons and why, and then go beyond symmetrical comparisons exploring some of the ways we can take full advantage of asymmetrical comparison methods.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt Story</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3302/getting-rich-with-comparison-methods</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcVQveUjq8U" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RcVQveUjq8U/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>How I Taught a 10-year-old to Love Python and Programming</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3298/how-i-taught-a-10-year-old-to-love-python-and-pro</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
After many trails and tribulations, a few months ago I finally got my 10-year-old brother hooked on programming with Python. I posted a brief snippet on reddit's /r/learnpython about it and the post went over very well, with many people asking me for more in-depth instructions of and a sort of curriculum they could use.

Human trafficking is still a huge issue in the world today. The industry commands 32 billion dollars in annual revenue a year (source: polaris project). As a professor and researcher at NYU I am developing tools to fight this horrible problem. Come learn about the work I've done so far and where my research is going. I will be showing you how recreate some of the tools I've made and used in python. I will be covering web scraping, text processing, and image processing.

I will be taking folks through a number of web scraping tools that I use to find instances of human trafficking. We will then go through classification algorithms I use to determine genuine instances of trafficking. Finally I will discuss image processing and facial recognition.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Eric Schles</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3299/how-i-use-python-to-fight-human-trafficking</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVsDUos_HHY" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NVsDUos_HHY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>How to write actually object-oriented python</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3306/how-to-write-actually-object-oriented-python</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

NumPy arrays combine the speed of C with the convenience of Python. It is the fundamental package for scientific and statistical computing in Python. MongoDB’s scale, speed, and flexibility make it ideal for storing large amounts of data. However, the official MongoDB driver is not optimized for loading MongoDB documents into NumPy arrays. Enter “Monary”, which allows you to easily examine and manipulate data using NumPy arrays. We will explore how Monary can accelerate your scientific analysis while providing you with the scale and flexibility of MongoDB and the ease of Python.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Kyle Suarez,Matt Cotter</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3314/monary-really-fast-analysis-with-mongodb-and-num</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oteFpXIKBYg" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oteFpXIKBYg/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>PyParallel</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3285/pyparallel</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

This talk will be an introductory discussion of why Python is an awesome programming language for analyzing, and playing with, natural language. (It’s not the only one, but especially for people just diving in to using a programming language for language play or research, it’s great.) Rather than going into details of algorithms, I'm going to give some simple, easy-to-build-upon examples of how Python and open source Python packages can be used to quickly dive into some really awesome aspects of research/investigation in linguistics, and bring them together to explain, at a high level, why I believe Python is an excellent bridge between linguists interested in programming, beginning programmers interested in linguistics, and any curious people who like figuring stuff out about languages all along a spectrum of formality.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jackie Cohen</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3309/python-for-curious-people-who-like-natural-langua</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJUi-PDjb6E" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aJUi-PDjb6E/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Python in the Video Game Industry</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3291/python-in-the-video-game-industry</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Python is used extensively in the video game industry at many levels. This talk is specifically about how Python based analytics can be integrated operationally into an organization at two levels: in ad hoc investigations and in production analytic services. This is about best practices in documented, reproducible and archived data investigations as well as production development with Python. A case study of an analytic service for cheating detection in Call of Duty Ghosts will make this real and provide some fun.

Twitter depends heavily on real-time event aggregation. Classic timeseries applications include site traffic, service health, and user engagement monitoring; these are increasingly complemented by a range of products and features that surface aggregated timeseries data directly to end users. Services that power such features need to be resilient enough to ensure a consistent user experience, flexible enough to accommodate a rapidly changing product roadmap, and able to scale to tens of billions of events per day.

Experience has shown that truly robust real-time aggregation services are hard to build; scaling and evolving them gracefully is even harder; and, moreover, many timeseries applications call for essentially the same architecture, with slight variations in the data model. Solving this broad class of problems at Twitter has been a multiyear effort. In previous talks we have introduced Summingbird, a high-level abstraction library for generalized distributed computation, which provides an elegant descriptive framework for complex aggregation problems. In this talk, I will describe how we built a flexible, reusable, end-to-end service architecture on top of Summingbird, called TSAR (the TimeSeries AggregatoR).

TSAR uses Python to provide an service toolkit that integrates with essential services that provide data processing, data warehousing, query capability, observability, and alerting, automatically configuring and orchestrating its components.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Anirudh Todi</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3307/tsar-the-timeseries-aggregator</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzHokP3NZu4" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XzHokP3NZu4/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Using Python with an Ordered Key-Value Store</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3315/using-python-with-an-ordered-key-value-store</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

If you're new to Python, you might find that you're using Python as if it were C. This talk will demonstrate how to take advantage of Python's special data structures to build tools for analyzing and creating nicely-formatted reports from CSV data. ("CSV" stands for "Comma Separated Values" although the term describes flat files where the fields in each row are delimited by commas, or tabs, or pipe characters, or whatever. )</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Margery Harrison</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3300/building-flexible-tools-to-store-sums-and-report</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWW7Sz28qZs" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NWW7Sz28qZs/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Caching up and down the stack in Django</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3287/caching-up-and-down-the-stack-in-django</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Whether you're looking to make your web app run faster or scale better, one great way to achieve both is to simply do less work. How? By using caches, the data hidey-holes which generations of engineers have thoughtfully left at key junctures in computing infrastructure from your CPU to the backbone of the internet.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">James Meickle</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3287/caching-up-and-down-the-stack-in-django</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kyc-YL34JU" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7kyc-YL34JU/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Confidence in the Lasso</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3312/confidence-in-the-lasso</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The lasso is one of the most significant machine learning algorithms from the past 15 years. Conceived by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman from Stanford, the lasso performs dimension reduction and variable selection making it well suited for the high dimensionality of today's datasets. In this talk we will go over some of the math behind the lasso and discuss some recent advancements in performing inference on lasso-fitted models.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jared Lander</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3312/confidence-in-the-lasso</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfzf0LiSwnM" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gfzf0LiSwnM/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Decorators 101: A Gentle Introduction to Functional Programming</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3320/decorators-101-a-gentle-introduction-to-function</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

Building service oriented web apps is a great way to separate concerns, parallelize development, and scale high traffic apps. One of the downsides of service oriented web applications, however, is managing the high overhead of communication between services, and handling the additional complexities that come along with service driven development.

Software programming is a young discipline, placed somewhere between the rigorous world of mathematics and the pragmatic world of engineering. As evidence of its immaturity as a discipline, consider how frequently the same problems arise in the practice of writing a programme, and how these problems are unaccompanied by widely-disseminated conceptualisations or a commonly agreed-upon pathology or even a well-defined guiding philosophy and epistemology. In other words, we keep running into the same problems, and we often lack even a basis for discussing them (much less avoiding them)!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">James Powell</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3284/the-pathetic-fallacy-or-an-engineering-approach</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GA4y6_I7b4" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GA4y6_I7b4/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Video, Python and FFmpeg: What you can do!</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3319/video-python-and-ffmpeg-what-you-can-do</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
