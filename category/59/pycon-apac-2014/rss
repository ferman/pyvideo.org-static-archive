The ever progressing technology is no doubt beneficial to mankind. However, the current inventions derived from new technology is not thorough enough to cover the needs of more focused groups. More importantly, students often find themselves hard to go beyond passively receiving information and stretch their own ability to become active drivers of positive change by channeling curriculum to real life. This is where innovation and creation of tailored applications set in. This talk, by a group of three students from Dunman High School, Singapore, serves to allow people to better understand the needs of high school students and how Python can be used to benefit them. Examples based on the authors' personal observations and experiences together with illustration of procedures and real-time demonstration will be presented to show how Python can be thoughtfully utilized as an inventive computational thinking and practical problem solving tool to enrich the lives of students. Through our sharing, we would like to inspire more ideas on developing Python applications of close relevance to students and hopefully, encourage more students to use Python to actively improve their school experience.

Asynchronised operations are good. Callbacks are not. Named callbacks clutter scopes and are disruptive. Anonymous callbacks create deeply nested code and become totally unreadable—Python does not even support that because it just lacks style! We deserve better. Let's take a look on how Python 3.4's new "asyncio" (aka Tulip) brings elegance to async tasks.

I will discuss the intersection of Open Source and scientific research, focusing on the positive impact that Open Source tools and ideas, and the Python community in particular, have had on the world of science. Scientific research is at a crossroads, under increasing pressure to justify itself to society at large and with very real questions being asked about the reproducibility of scientific results and access to the products of science. The Open Source community have created both technical and cultural solutions to similar problems that we as scientists can learn from. The Python language has also made major inroads into research and education, helping foster a culture of better computational research and opening up a space for a lot of creativity at the intersection of science and computing.

Here's her challenge for the community: by next year's PyCon, we would like to see every folk does one thing to further the cause of the next generation of Python programmers.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jessica McKellar</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3272/python-under-the-sea-in-space-and-back-home-p</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGwSC6UnYTg" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eGwSC6UnYTg/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Rapid Web Development with Mezzanine</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3260/rapid-web-development-with-mezzanine-pycon-apac</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The modern world of Python web development is chock-full of choices today - do we use a micro or a monolithic framework? Do we use a CMS or roll our own? Mezzanine is one project that aims to simplify these questions with a compelling offering for developing Python powered websites.

In this talk, Stephen McDonald the creator of Mezzanine will walk through the history of Mezzanine, covering the constraints that have dictated its design, its approach to providing simple yet flexible, rapid web development, through to the software eco-system and community that have developed around it.

Behind the glamour of mobile apps, business SaaS products have been steadily building itself into a billion dollar industry. With companies such as Salesforce spearheading the adaption of business SaaS products in corporate, startups are rising to take on the SME market.

With hot topics such as "big data" and "machine learning" flying around, it may seem overwhelming to put an idea into action. I will walk through the process of building an data analytics minimum viable product (MVP). Attendees will have hands on experiences with the free and/or affordable technology and services that can get their MVP up and running.

This talk assumes attendees understand the basic of Python. Basic understanding of MapReduce and NoSQL databases will be big pluses as well.

Knowledge graph is the new search engine technology. All the leading search engine exploit knowledge graph to provide more accurate result to user, e.g. Bing, Google, Yahoo.

In this talk, the speaker will demonstrate how to build a searchable knowledge graph from scratch. Lots of python tools will be applied during the process. The process includes data wrangling, graph entity indexing, full text search and web visualization. The data sources are from dbpedia.org. Enormous amount of entities are collected and stored to graph database for relationship querying and full text search engine for searching. In the web visualization, a searchable interface and visualized result demonstrate the knowledgable information to customer.

Python becomes increasingly popular in the domain of big data analysis. Many big data frameworks such as Hadoop now support Python to some extent. PySociaLite is a new big data framework developed at Stanford. It is designed from beginning to be fully integrated into Python. In PySociaLite, SQL-like queries (called SociaLite) are directly embedded within Python code; the queries can access Python variables and functions, so there is full inter-operation between SociaLite and Python.

In this talk, I will give a brief overview of SociaLite, then mainly present the techniques for the integration of SociaLite into Python. SociaLite builds on top of well-known programming concepts -- tables and relational operations -- and it allows users to declare distributed tables to perform, for example, distributed join operations. For the integration of SociaLite into Python, we basically extend Jython interpreter to process embedded SociaLite queries. More specificaly, we use PyParsing to recognize SociaLite queries and re-write the queries into Java function calls. We also use lesser-known Python features, such as import hooks to process SociaLite queries within imported modules. To access Python functions within SociaLite, Jython interpreter instance (from which SociaLite queries are executed) is passed to SociaLite runtime system, and used to lookup and access Python functions. For the distributed execution, Python functions are serialized (as well as its PyCode object) and copied to cluster machines. 

Time permitting, I will give a demo of PySociaLite; SociaLite queries will be executed interactively within (extended) Jython shell and demonstrate the inter-operation between SociaLite and Python.


About the speaker

Jiwon Seo is a PhD student in Stanford university, studying parallel query language for data analysis. He contributed to Python in various ways; for example, he implemented PEP 289 (Generator Expressions) and PEP 3102 (Keyword-Only Arguments).

He designed and implemented a parallel and distributed query language, called SociaLite. The SociaLite compiler generates efficient parallel/distributed code from user queries. SociaLite queries can be embedded in Python programs, allowing users to enjoy flexibility of Python and efficiency of SociaLite.

We all start our programming with single process in mind. But parallelization from scratch is a real headache. Things get worse when it comes to writing a spaghetti code in both short time and high performance, which is often the case doing data analysis.

In fact, cases like computation under different conditions, programs can be easily parallelized (distributed) with a few modifications using existed library like multiprocessing, IPython Parallel, and Celery.

This talk makes you not afraid of parallel or distributed computing and provides ways for different level of parallelization from single machine, cluster, to cluster with task queue. I will only talk about the basic scenario, which should be easier for newbies to try on and understand how powerful these tools can be.

A machine learning example will be given in the end to compare performance and possible issues with different implementations.

Fliptop's primary business used to be contact record linkage. We built-out some substantial infrastructure, coding primarily in Scala, and using JVM-stack libraries. In the past year, we've moved beyond our data business into building predictive analytics applications for Sales and Marketing teams, so it was necessary to build a data science/machine learning stack. While there's plenty of machine-learning tools for the JVM, we felt that the Python ecosystem had many advantages for our use-case (which we'll discuss), and we think we integrated them in a clever way.

As hackathons become more prevalent, one thing has (mostly) stayed the same: the ratio of male to female hackathon participants is often lower than the ratio in the broader computer science community. 

How can hackathon organizers be mindful of this issue, and encourage a diverse pool of participants? This talk will cover the basics of how to run an inclusive hackathon, as well as successful strategies organizers have used in the past. We will examine case studies of several of the largest college hackathons.

We can never rely on network firewall to be secure. We also must have a secure application. Besides test the functionality of the application, we must also test the security of the application. While the latter is frequently not performed hence the first is considered more important.

In this 25 minute talk, I'll share my experience using python for application security testing: from SQL injection, brute force attack, identifying and cracking password hashes, to proxy-ing the network traffic: intercept and modify it; and also doing network forensic.

Pyhton has great power in scrapping and analyzing data, and D3.js is a great tool for building visual interface. In the first part of the talk, I will demonstrate how to set up D3.js as an interactive layer on top of Python. In the second part of the talk, I will show what it can achieve, by using the "Taiwan Vegetable Auction" dataset (past 10 years transaction data of 127 kinds of vegetable, 1GB).

The dataset is too large for human to see through, a machine learning algorithm will be able to fit a regression model on the dataset, but it can't make sense of it. For example, in the following graph: 

You can see the average price of green onion in different markets for the past 20 years, the fluctuation between different markets are similar, yet since 2010, there is a perfectly horizontal blue line: while price in the other markets have changes, price in "Taitung" has remained exactly the same, suggesting a possible case of monopoly. One can then asks the system to detect other cases of monopoly. This process of exploratory data analysis can only be possible with both machine and human. 

From a technical perspective, this talk can benefit front-end developer/data scientist to set up such a system. Yet a more profound value of the talk will be to explore how machine and human can work together.

Holding a conference needs continuous efforts, especially when you're in charge of all those administration stuff. Simple solutions could end up with management death spiral, while complex systems like Redmine would be an overkill. Roboconf is the home-made solution we've brought up: a conference operation site built upon Django, with issue tracking, document organizing, notifications, and staff management all in one place. In this session, I'll describe situations we faced when organizing SITCON 2013, how Roboconf got itself implemented, what difference it has made throughout the process, and crazy stuff other folks at SITCON built around this system.

VapourSynth is a powerful tool for video post-production. In contrast to video editing tools with GUI interface, it parses expressions and statements from Python script, builds corresponding filter graph, and cheats output video as regular uncompressed RGB/YUV AVI stream file. Thus, everyone can view video editing result just by playing Python script as a regular AVI file.

The concept of VapourSynth is based on AviSynth, the most famous script based video editing tools. However, AviSynth is too old, inefficient, has disorder filter set, and there are many limitations in its specific script language (lack of for/while loop). That is why project holder introduces many advantages into VapourSynth, such as better resource usage, frame level concurrent processing, simplified filter set, and describes video processing flow with Python!

Will VapourSynth be the future of script based video editing? Let's make some simple VapourSynth scripts and realize what VapourSynth can do!

Although there are several data mining tools in python, you can use them to
deal with almost every kind of data (numeric, text, image, audio, ...) you met.
Besides, there are also lots of modeling tools in python, you can use them to
build the FIRST LIGHTING MODEL to solve the problems.

However, if you want to solve problems deeply, most of time, you need to write
down the customerized models and solve them by yourself. Instead of using fast
modeling tools, you need to know more about the essential things in modeling:

- What is a model ? 
- How models solve your problems ?
- What is the connection between models and data ?
- What is the important data ? important model ?

I deeply believe ... The more the connection between models and data you know, the deeper the problem you can solve.

Outline:
What is Modeling ?  
Data, Model, Evaluators  
Direct Problem: Data + Evaluators → Model  
Inverse Problem: Data + Models → Evaluator  
Hacking Models with Metric Learning  
Data as a Model &amp; Model as a Data  
Duality between Dimension Reduction and Clustering

Python's asynchronous frameworks, like asyncio, Tornado, and Twisted, are increasingly important for writing high-performance web applications. Even if you're an experienced web programmer, you may lack a rigorous understanding of how these frameworks work and when to use them. Let's see how asyncio's event loop works, and learn how to efficiently handle very large numbers of concurrent connections.

Attendees will learn when to use async and when not to. They'll learn about asyncio, a major new feature in the Python 3.4 standard library: what it is, how it works, and how to use it for high-concurrency web programming.

Apache Spark™ is a lightning fast engine for large-scale data processing. It is an in-memory cluster computing framework, originally developed in UC Berkeley. Base on it's project page's evaluation, machine learning programming can run program 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce. And Spark can run on Hadoop 2's YARN cluster manager, and can read any existing Hadoop data. Currently, it supports Scala, Java and Python for writing spark programs. 

In this talk, I will introduce the General concept of Spark's infrastructure, What is RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) in Spark, Introduction on PySpark, Demo of PySpark's speed and power, Head-to-head comparison between two programs doing same work - one written in Hadoop MapReduce and the other written using PySpark.

I will also conclude about the companies currently using Spark's use cases.

SOLVCON is a collection of Python-based conservation-law solvers and uses the space-time Conservation Element and Solution Element (CESE) method. SOLVCON targets at providing a reusable code base for systems of first-order, linear or non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs). In addition to numerical methods, modern conservation-law simulations require code for parallel computing and flexible input, output, and work flow. Researchers spend a lot of time in these supportive functionalities, although they should have focused on the physical processes or numerical methods. Further, SOLVCON emphasizes the connections among documenting, coding, and testing. Many Python-based tools are used in the development, e.g., Sphinx, NumPy, Cython, nose, etc. SOLVCON is open-source and uses a BSD-style license.

Statistics is essential to data analysis, and many people choose R because of its great package diversity. With the advent of pandas, Python becomes one of the hottest language to do data analysis, and it will be more helpful if we can do statistics in Python as well. 

In this talk, I will first introduce how to do statistics in Python using statsmodel and some related functions implemented in Numpy and Scipy. 

Then I will introduces the communication from Python to R using rpy2, and give you advices or alternatives about when to use this approach or not.
