"On the internet, fraudulent and abusive behavior is considered especially heinous. At Heroku, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad armed with large amounts of data and spare CPU cycles. These are their stories."

Bad behavior can wreak havoc on your web application. It might be mass-signups, fraudulent orders, spammy posts, right up to automated bots designed to work around restrictions you have set in place; this can cost you time, resources, and lots of money. All is not lost though. Despite the ongoing efforts of abusers, their activity still leaves fingerprints and clues, which you can use to your advantage.

This talk is a 101 introduction to some of the methods which you can use to separate good from bad users using a combination of data mining, statistics, and some some basic machine learning. Basically, I want to get you thinking like an internet detective.

Some of the topics I will be covering include:

- Collecting and preparing data sources.
- Effective methods for classifying existing users.
- Feature extracting; what works and what doesn't.
- Analyzing user-provided data to profile your users, and weed out the bad operators.
- Determining a user's intentions by looking at their access patterns.
- Making use of 'outliers' to find suspicious users and transactions.
- Stopping bad users before they can wreak havoc.

As this is a 101 topic I will provide some basic examples, as well as links to more in-depth resources for further reading. I would recommend this talk to developers of web applications, especially those with a large number of users, the ability to process credit cards, or with a 'free' offering. Attendees should have a basic understanding of topics such as SQL, Pandas, and some basic understanding of mathematics and statistics, although this is not essential as I will be providing links to further reading.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rhys Elsmore</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3107/benfords-law-and-order-fraud-by-rhys-elsmore</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/56-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/56-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VO8QxIkjqY" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/_VO8QxIkjqY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Building Better Web APIs by HawkOwl</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3104/building-better-web-apis-by-hawkowl</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Web APIs are how much of the modern web speaks - services speaking HTTP and JSON are ubiquitous, and nearly everything from your phone to your TV interacts with one of them. We'll go over how APIs are structured and versioned, why you should validate your data, and why you should have them in the first place -- and what other best practices are when creating them.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">HawkOwl</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3104/building-better-web-apis-by-hawkowl</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/67-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/67-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXa4SV3E5JY" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/pXa4SV3E5JY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Caching: A trip down the rabbit hole by Tom Eastman</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3111/caching-a-trip-down-the-rabbit-hole-by-tom-eastm</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The question: How do I make my website fast?

If that sounds like a loaded question to you: good, we're on the same page.

In this talk I will give you a full overview of one of the most powerful and headache-inducing tools in the web-developer's kit: caching.

This is a talk for all experience levels, from beginner to seriously brain-melty. The code and scenarios we'll be exploring are within the context of a Django project, but the principles are applicable to all of web development.

We'll begin our journey in the light, warm land of web browser caches: learning how you can make your users' web browsers do all the work for you. Making your site feel rocket-fast and responsive with little more than some finely crafted HTTP response headers.

From there, we'll begin our descent into the underworld of server-level caching, using reverse-proxies such as Varnish or Nginx that shield the application code from having to do any work. What they do, how they can help, and more important -- when do they *not* help, and when do you have to go deeper.

Finally we'll explore the dark art of application-level caching. Whether it's caching whole responses, partial responses, preventing repetitive SQL queries or expensive API response serialization calls. And, if our brains haven't exploded yet, we might throw in some asynchronous cached-view-generation  just for good measure.

Whether you're a hobbyist or a grizzled veteran, you should come out of this talk with a few new tricks up your sleeve for making all your sites do more with less work.

Expect references from -- depending on mood -- Alice in Wonderland, The Matrix, or Dante Alighieri's "Inferno".</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom Eastman</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3111/caching-a-trip-down-the-rabbit-hole-by-tom-eastm</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/28-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/28-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIWnQ3F1eLA" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/bIWnQ3F1eLA/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Clustering of high-content screen images to discover off-target phenotypes by Juan Nunez-Iglesias</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3109/clustering-of-high-content-screen-images-to-disco</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Juan Nunez-Iglesias</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3109/clustering-of-high-content-screen-images-to-disco</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/104-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/104-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxKf7LGf7x8" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qxKf7LGf7x8/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Continuous Integration Testing for Your Database Migrations by Joshua Hesketh</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3094/continuous-integration-testing-for-your-database</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
This is a talk about how OpenStack does database migration continuous integration, and how other projects might be able to learn from what we've done.

OpenStack is an interesting project in that it runs in a variety of different scale scenarios. There are very small deployments of only a few machines, and large public clouds with thousands of machines. The OpenStack project takes Continuous Integration (CI) very seriously, and runs a suite of unit and integration tests on all proposed patches.

One thing we weren't very good at testing though, was database upgrades. We have unit tests for many of them, but we don't know how these upgrades affect real users in the field. As a response, we worked on adding database migration testing to our CI environment. This new test infrastructure is open source (https://github.com/stackforge/turbo-hipster), and extensible. It currently runs tests on smaller databases, as well as a largish real user database. It has already caught two significant performance problems in database migrations.

This talk will cover how we built the test infrastructure (in python!). It will cover what we've learned from the 12 months of running it - time that we'll have had by the conference day. It will tell a story about some of the bugs we've found and how we fixed them.

Modern Python developers depend on a large number of 3rd party packages. This in turn introduces a problem: how to manage those packages for rapid, reliable deployment in a world where the central repository - PyPi (the Cheese Shop) - is out of their control. Additionally, private packages may be developed which need to seamlessly be integrated into the deployment systems.

In this talk I will present devpi, a PyPI (Cheese Shop) server and packaging/testing/release tool. I will cover its reasons for existing, its many capabilities and configuration for some common scenarios.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Richard Jones</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3103/devpi-your-one-stop-cheese-shop-by-richard-jones</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/64-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/64-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZTiAkwiPgI" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/pZTiAkwiPgI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Grug make fire!

In prehistoric times, Python developers were faced with a confusing landscape of tools and conflicting advice when they wanted to package their Python modules for public release. As a result of all the distutils/distribute/setuptools changes over the last 5 years, there's lots of confusion about what you should do when preparing a package for distribution - and even some confusion about what the purpose of packaging is in the first place.

After a mammoth effort from a number of volunteers in the community, over several years, this situation is changing. It's taken a while, but the Python community has invented the wheel!

In this talk, we'll look at the process that has led to the development of the wheel format. But more importantly, we'll look at the steps you need to take when packaging a module of Python code for others to use, and get it on the Python Package Index (PyPI).</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Russell Keith-Magee</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3087/grug-make-fire-grug-make-wheel-by-russell-keith</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/49-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/49-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtFHIpNPMPA" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/UtFHIpNPMPA/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>How do debug tool bars for web applications work? by Graham Dumpleton</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3098/how-do-debug-tool-bars-for-web-applications-work</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
When your production web application breaks, working out what went wrong can be hard. Information from log messages and details of any Python exceptions which occurred, along with other application performance data can help to identify the issue, but not always. Often you will need to fall back to a development or test environment and hope you can replicate the problem and then debug the issue from there.

The purpose of this talk is to dive in and look at one class of tools that can be used in helping debug web applications. Specifically, it will look at web application tools such as the Django debug tool bar.

Rather than simply look at how you might use such a tool though, this talk will look at how these debug tool bars are actually implemented, how they hook into your web application, how they capture the information that they do, as well as how they can be extended to add new functionality.

The limitations on these tools as far as performance overhead, security of data etc, which nearly aways lead to them only being recommended for development environments, will also be discussed.

At the same time though, this notion that they are only suitable for development environments will also be challenged by looking at how a tool such as the New Relic Python agent, which implements application performance monitoring, overcomes such limitations to provide a production grade solution.

Are there lessons to be learnt from how the New Relic Python agent works which could drive improvements to existing web application debug tool bars? Could the New Relic Python agent itself be used as a base for a new generation of debug tool bars which combine an ability to debug a web application, even in a production environment, with the ability to monitor the performance of the web application over time?</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Graham Dumpleton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014

Pandas is increasingly becoming a standard tool in scientific computing.  Could it also have a role in the CFO's office?
 
CFOs regularly need to analyse the impact of different projects or business cases, and they almost universally do this using spreadsheets.  Spreadsheets have many advantages - they have a low barrier to entry and are easy for most people to understand.  However as they get more complicated, disadvantages start to appear; in particular, they can be inflexible and highly error-prone.
 
In this talk I will explain how business case analysis can be done using python and pandas.  The python version has several advantages over spreadsheets: it is more flexible as the business structure changes; formulas only need to be changed in a single place, reducing the chance of error; and report-ready plots are quick to produce.  I'll go through a way of structuring the problem for some simple business logic, and ways to visualise the results.
 
The example I’ll discuss is made more interesting and useful by being “Monte Carlo” analysis. Traditional business case analysis takes single point estimates of sales, costs and prices, and calculates a single profit forecast. Everybody knows the profit will not turn out to be exactly equal to the forecast.  But it is not clear what the range of profits might be, or how likely a loss is.  "Monte Carlo" analysis solves this problem by allowing ranges or distributions on the assumptions; the forecast is then a range of outcomes.
 
In short, I’ll demonstrate how you can use pandas to analyse high-impact business decisions, and dodge many of the problems of using spreadsheets.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Arthur Street</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3090/science-miniconf-monte-carlo-business-case-analy</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/98-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/98-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcMaO2f7ww4" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/KcMaO2f7ww4/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Science MiniConf: Python for Bioinformatics by Clare Sloggett</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3091/science-miniconf-python-for-bioinformatics-by-cl</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Clare Sloggett</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3091/science-miniconf-python-for-bioinformatics-by-cl</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/100-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/100-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKcRcdu9X3Y" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/jKcRcdu9X3Y/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Science MiniConf: Python, Pyramid, and Embedded Devices by Justin Clacherty</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3100/science-miniconf-python-pyramid-and-embedded-d</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Justin Clacherty</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3100/science-miniconf-python-pyramid-and-embedded-d</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/108-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/108-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scgudhbfmjA" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/scgudhbfmjA/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Science Miniconf: Welcome</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3096/science-miniconf-welcome-by-graeme-cross</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

In 2013 I purchased a Ninja Block (http://ninjablocks.com/) and wanted to add a camera based sensor to it. So began my adventures in computer vision using python. The talk will discuss the various libraries (including PyOpenCV &amp; SimpleCV ) available for python to perform CV tasks like motion detection, object tracking &amp; facial recognition. As my goals for the camera sensor underwent "feature creep" the project required it's own dedicated processing power, so a BeagleBone Black &amp; later a Raspberry Pi were purchased and the project became a IoT device. I will also share my experiences with developing python CV solutions ARM based computers. If the demo gods are willing, code examples will be demonstrated.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Mark Rees</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3095/seeing-with-python-by-mark-rees</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/58-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/58-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlgMwSHyXcg" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/WlgMwSHyXcg/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Software Carpentry in Australia: current activity and future directions by Damien Irving</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3092/software-carpentry-in-australia-current-activity</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Software Carpentry is a volunteer organisation that teaches basic software skills to researchers in science, engineering and medicine. Supported by the Mozilla Science Lab, it runs two-day bootcamps all over the world, provides open access material for self-paced instruction, and runs a training program for aspiring instructors. The core two-day curriculum includes the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive tasks); Python or R (and how to grow a program in a modular, testable way); Git and GitHub (and how to track and share work efficiently); and SQL (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).     

While the organisation has been around for over a decade, it had a breakout year in 2013. The number of qualified instructors swelled to over 100 and collectively they ran over 100 events for over 4300 researchers in a dozen countries. To kick things off in Australia, the founder of Software Carpentry (Dr. Greg Wilson) visited Sydney and Melbourne in February 2013 to host the first ever bootcamps outside of Europe and North America. Since that visit five local instructors have been trained up and have delivered an additional ten bootcamps around the country.

This presentation will review the first year of Software Carpentry activities in Australia, with a particular focus on the key lessons learned in teaching computational best practices to the research community. Future plans and directions will also be outlined, including an overview of an innovative new project called the Research Bazaar. Coordinated out of The University of Melbourne, this project has started offering regular bootcamps to researchers in the Melbourne area and looks set to inspire widespread institutional support for bootcamp delivery. The Software Carpentry teaching materials are also undergoing rapid development, with work on an advanced curriculum and new lessons on “data carpentry” already underway. There are very few examples of open, collaborative lesson development in the education sector, so the application of routine software development practices in this space (e.g. version control, pull requests, and the progressive release of new versions) is somewhat ground breaking.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Damien Irving</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3092/software-carpentry-in-australia-current-activity</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/43-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/43-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ12NmsLfsg" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/sQ12NmsLfsg/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Sounds good! by Sebastian Beswick</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3097/sounds-good-by-sebastian-beswick</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Do you know if it’s worth upgrading your Spotify account to stream songs at 320kb/s?

An understanding of the fundamentals of computer sound is essential for the well-rounded IT professional. Audio is a field that is teeming with jargon, but it doesn’t have to be so scary! In this session we’ll go back to basics and take a look at the core components of sound, including how we (as humans) perceive sounds, and how we can represent them within a computer. By the end of this session, you'll know enough to go home and create your own simple synthesiser!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sebastian Beswick</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3097/sounds-good-by-sebastian-beswick</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/55-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/55-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGhmPyJKcjU" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/RGhmPyJKcjU/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Tempest: OpenStack Integrated Testing by Matthew Treinish (HP)</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3110/tempest-openstack-integrated-testing-by-matthew</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matthew Treinish</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3110/tempest-openstack-integrated-testing-by-matthew</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/91-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/91-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBvPj_QFnQY" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/KBvPj_QFnQY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>The Curse of the Django Podcast by Elena Williams</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3088/the-curse-of-the-django-podcast-by-elena-williams</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The Django community is full of amazing, enthusiastic and multi-talented individuals who love to take on exciting new extra-curricular projects in their massive amounts of spare time. 

A Django podcast is an excellent example of this kind of project and it is one that has been taken up no less than 5 times so far.

I am the latest to take up this torch.

This has so far been an amazing, educational, exhilarating experience: I have had the honour of gathering the thoughts of some of the best, brightest and most prolific in our community. It's been a load of work but also a load of fun.

Come hear the story of how this has happened, and come to learn how you can be part of the greater Django information and communication machinery.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World.

Writing a program in Python targeting the Android environment is well within your reach with the use of third party kits such as Kivy and the Pygame Subset for Android.  

Kivy is an "Open source Python library for rapid development of applications" and comes with tools which allow Kivy based programs to be packaged as Android apks for deployment to Android devices.   In this session I will give an overview of the Kivy development and deployment process.  I will also draw inspiration from my successes and failures in developing Python programs with Kivy to highlight Kivy's strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncracies.   Code examples will be kept to a minimum, with a focus on illustrating the capabilities of the Kivy library and explaining how its parts work together. 

I will also reserve some time to discuss the Pygame Subset for Android and how it can be used to deploy Pygame based games to Android devices.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brendan Scott</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3113/deploy-to-android-adventures-of-a-hobbyist-by-br</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/37-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/37-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KPcBOpC-rw" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4KPcBOpC-rw/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Django Miniconf: Closing Keynote by Tony Morris</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3138/django-miniconf-closing-keynote-by-tony-morris</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tony Morris</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3138/django-miniconf-closing-keynote-by-tony-morris</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/124-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/124-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqsZa36Io2M" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/uqsZa36Io2M/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Django MiniConf: Django Transactions: Past, Present, and Future by Christophe Pettus</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3118/django-miniconf-django-transactions-past-prese</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Christophe Pettus</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3118/django-miniconf-django-transactions-past-prese</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/116-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/116-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppwT0u98TmQ" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ppwT0u98TmQ/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Django MiniConf: Writing Reusable Django Apps by Jacob Haslehurst</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3134/django-miniconf-writing-reusable-django-apps-by</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jacob Haslehurst</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3134/django-miniconf-writing-reusable-django-apps-by</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/118-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/118-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvvKP_GaPmw" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/VvvKP_GaPmw/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Graphs, Networks and Python:  The Power of Interconnection by Lachlan Blackhall</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3132/graphs-networks-and-python-the-power-of-interc</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Graph and network structures are everywhere and can be found in social, biological and technological networks that impact us on a daily basis. Understanding, and exploiting, graphical structures creates opportunities for obtaining new analytic insights, implementing new computational paradigms, and better defining the relationship between objects of any sort.

Python provides access to these graph and network structures using the fantastic NetworkX library (http://networkx.github.io/) .  In this presentation we will give an introduction to the NetworkX library, showing how easy it is to build and exploit simple graphical and network structures.

From that starting point we will then discuss a number of more complicated, real world examples of how the NetworkX library can be used to:
 - Analyse social networks to extract valuable information about people / entities within those networks.
 - Implement reconfigurable processing pipelines (something we refer to as computational graphs) for data capture, processing and analytics.
 - Easily track the relationship between Python objects in a variety of other interesting and useful scenarios.

This presentation will be targeted at intermediate developers and no prior experience with graphs, networks or NetworkX is required. This presentation will offer an easy introduction to the world of networks and graphs in Python and will illustrate real world uses of this powerful and useful paradigm.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Lachlan Blackhall</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3132/graphs-networks-and-python-the-power-of-interc</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/29-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/29-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7FBxy1Rds" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/1q7FBxy1Rds/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Learning to program is hard, and how to fix that by Jackson Gatenby</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3112/learning-to-program-is-hard-and-how-to-fix-that</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
There are a lot of hurdles to overcome when learning your first programming language - What does this error mean? What's the difference between a for loop and a while loop? How does pass-by-reference evaluation work? What are classes? How do I even begin to turn this task into a working program?

Python is widely used as a language for learning to program, and for good reasons, but there are still plenty of ways that students can get stuck, both in learning the language, and in learning more abstract programming concepts.

This talk will present a number of challenges frequently faced by beginner students in a university course which teaches students Python from the ground up, and how the course material was redesigned both to make it easier for students to learn, but also to ensure that students encountered all of the necessary challenges so that they'd have something to learn.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jackson Gatenby</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3112/learning-to-program-is-hard-and-how-to-fix-that</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/34-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/34-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf8DXDEWnaw" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/qf8DXDEWnaw/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Lesser known data structures by Tim McNamara</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3117/lesser-known-data-structures-by-tim-mcnamara</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Python is graced with flexible, easy to use data structures that are at your fingertips every time you start a command prompt. Lists, dictionaries and tuples are our friends. However, sometimes you want more than what they can give.

While subclassing is a great approach, often what you want has already been written. Most often, it’ll be waiting for you within the standard library. This talk will be a tour of some of what awaits you. Don’t be the next person to recreate an ordered dictionary.

Within the collections module, as well as other places within the standard library, you’ll find lots of functionality. Using these data structures can lead to simpler, more robust code.

As well as explaining how to use some of the data structures that we encounter, we’ll also be checking through open source code to see how they are used in the real world. This will give us insight into how other programmers are using them.

Drawing on her experiences teaching introductory programming with Arduino-based robots, Anna will step through a tutorial demonstrating how to develop a mobile PyBot - a robot programmed using Python and the Firmata protocol, and will provide tips to help you or the apprentice coders in your life to take the first steps towards a lifetime of loving to code.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Anna Gerber</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3137/pybots-or-how-to-learn-to-stop-worrying-and-love</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/30-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/30-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3birX_l-YZ8" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/3birX_l-YZ8/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Record linkage: Join for real life by Rhydwyn Mcguire</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3115/record-linkage-join-for-real-life-by-rhydwyn-mcg</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
In an ideal world, you can join on candidate keys, names are never misspelt, people never move house, and I have a pony. I don’t have a pony. But we do have record linkage. 

Record linkage (also known as data linkage or fuzzy record matching) is a naive Bayes algorithm which matches data about individuals across databases or within a single database, by constructing the probabilities that two records apply to the same individual or to different individuals.

In this talk I will discuss the techniques of record linkage in Python, the usefulness and the limitations of linkage, and the effect that this technique is having on healthcare research in particular.

Healthcare/epidemiology studies often require data from more than one source, and individuals frequently have multiple interactions with a data set without a unique identifier. The outcomes of these studies are only as good as the record linkage which underlies them, so the ways in which record linkage is done can have a direct impact on our ability to understand, prevent and treat serious medical conditions.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rhydwyn Mcguire</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3115/record-linkage-join-for-real-life-by-rhydwyn-mcg</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/35-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/35-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEcVIjyHfiQ" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/cEcVIjyHfiQ/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Running Django on Docker: a workflow and code</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3136/running-django-on-docker-a-workflow-and-code-by</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Docker (http://docker.io) is the hot-new-thing out there for running your application in development and in production. Here at Infoxchange, we are extremely excited about how Docker allows a build-once, run-anywhere approach to moving applications from testing through to production. We are one of the first organisations to be using Docker in production on high-SLA applications.

In this talk we will present:

- a quick intro to Docker and how it solves our problems at Infoxchange;
- our interface for hosting applications on Docker ("pallet");
- how to build and develop a Python app on Docker;
- Infoxchange's Django settings module for the pallet interface;
- Forklift (https://github.com/infoxchange/docker-forklift), a tool we've developed for running and developing apps that use the pallet interface, in and out of a Docker container; and
- Extending forklift for your services.

If time permits we will try and cover the additional bonus topics:

- How to host your legacy mod_python application on Apache inside Docker with minimal changes; and
- Using Forklift to do automated full-stack integration testing of apps by spinning up containers of other apps (which we do in a container that is testing the built app that is running in a container that is our CI server... inception is possible).

The talk will be presented by Danielle Madeley and Alexey Kotlyarov.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alexey Kotlyarov,Danielle Madeley</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3136/running-django-on-docker-a-workflow-and-code-by</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/19-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/19-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgL8r--p97s" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgL8r--p97s/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Software Component Architectures and circuits? by James Mills</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3116/software-component-architectures-and-circuits-by</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Python Asynchronous Frameworks are plentiful in the Python Community. There is Twisted, gevent, Tornado, asynccore and now with Python 3.4, asyncio. circuits is not yet another Asynchronous Framework (although it does support Async I/O) but a strong well defined Component Architecture for building complex software with changing requirements. If you have ever developed with Zope or Kamaelia you will be familiar with the "Component" concept. circuits offers a unique perspective on Component Architectures and offers a novel way to design, implement and deploy complex software.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">James Mills</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3116/software-component-architectures-and-circuits-by</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/22-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/22-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGrbp0LOH84" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/DGrbp0LOH84/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Try A Little Randomness by Larry Hastings</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3119/try-a-little-randomness-by-larry-hastings</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

Come to this talk if you want to learn a few basic techniques for putting numerical data in context. If you've ever predicted anything, or tried to work out whether some number was "good enough", you'll probably get something out of this presentation. All techniques and tools demonstrated using Python.

Every day, decisions both big and small are made on the basis of the information published by the Bureau of Meteorology. These include simple decisions such as taking an umbrella or planning a barbecue. Our forecasts also inform Australia's emergency services on where extreme weather events may have occurred, to help with planning and preparation.
 
Understanding and communicating our strengths and weaknesses is very important, both as an organisation and also internally within the Environment and Research division. This presentation will focus on the statistical methods and systems used to evaluate the objective, scientific performance of our forecast systems. The name for this area of study is "Verification". While the concepts have come from the research environment, they are widely applicable and can help anyone who is assessing the performance of any system.
 
This presentation will include:
  -- An overview of the major ideas of verification
  -- How to create a 'skill score'
  -- The application of these concepts to thunderstorm forecasting
  -- How to use Python tools for verification analyses
  -- Tips on how to apply these ideas easily in other contexts
 
Obtaining relevant thunderstorm observational data can be particularly challenging, particularly pertaining to severe and damaging aspects: lightning, hail, heavy rain and very strong wind gusts. In order achieve a stronger footing, some new methods of analysis are under development. It is necessary to establish the scientific validity of the verification metrics at the same time as constructing the systems to support the data analysis.
 
A prototype web-based tool written in Python (and under active development by the presenter) will be demonstrated. This tool can run locally to provide an enhanced lab environment for assessing case study data, or be set up as a server for continuous monitoring and reporting.
 
No pre-existing knowledge of Python or statistics is assumed. The talk will include several technical aspects, such as working at different computing scales, usability and user experience, working with statistical algorithms, data visualisation for both web and journal publications, and the architectural challenges of a complex application.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tennessee Leeuwenburg</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3114/verification-truth-in-statistics-by-tennessee-le</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/27-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/27-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0DE_UfRiXE" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/c0DE_UfRiXE/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>What in the World is Asyncio? by Josh Bartlett</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3133/what-in-the-world-is-asyncio-by-josh-bartlett</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The Python 3.4 standard library contains a new module called "asyncio" (formerly "tulip"), which allows you to write single-threaded asynchronous code based on PEP 3156. This presentation will begin with an outline of what asyncio provides and how to use it, highlighting the kinds of use cases that it was designed for. The presentation will then go through a number of example use cases and within the context of these use cases, will compare asyncio with Twisted, one of the existing libraries for asynchronous programming. Finally, the presentation will touch on the question of interoperability between asyncio and libraries like Twisted, Pyramid and gevent.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Josh Bartlett</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3133/what-in-the-world-is-asyncio-by-josh-bartlett</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/45-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/45-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4YjNKSQVAI" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/N4YjNKSQVAI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Command line programs for busy developers by Aaron Iles</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3129/command-line-programs-for-busy-developers-by-aaro</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Command line interface tools are the new web framework. In addition to the
Python standard library's getopt, optparse and argparse there is a bewildering
array of packages available on the Python Packaging Index. Packages like Click,
Cliff, Docopt, Invoke all provide different mechanics for creating command line
applications. When all you want to do is expose a command line and get back to
creating functionality, it’s hard to know which alternative to reach for.

This presentation will have two parts, the first half will be a brief survey
of popular modules. Strengths, weaknesses and design philosophies will be
compared by creating command line processing for the same example program.

The second half will go into more depth on a specific package, Begins. This
package was authored by the presenter to minimise the disruption developers
experience when breaking flow to implement command line processing. The
audience will be shown how a single line of code can create a complex command
line interface. It will also be shown how a handful of decorators from the
Begins API can eliminate boilerplate code and create powerful, complex
applications.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Aaron Iles</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3129/command-line-programs-for-busy-developers-by-aaro</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/57-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/57-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5l4JNt2ozI" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/D5l4JNt2ozI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Descriptors: attribute access redefined by Fraser Tweedale</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3123/descriptors-attribute-access-redefined-by-fraser</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Descriptors are a powerful feature of Python that can be used to augment or replace traditional attribute access with arbitrary behaviours.  Such versatility makes the descriptor protocol a valuable tool for any Python programmer, yet although most of us have used descriptors, fewer have implemented one.

This presentation will explain the use cases that motivate descriptors and how other features in Python fall short.  We will then look at some of the descriptors that the audience may already have used (even if they didn't know they were using descriptors!)  This will be followed with an explanation of the descriptor protocol and some implementation and usage examples.

I will discuss some of the finer details of descriptor implementation and will conclude with a look at Elk - a declarative object system authored by the presenter and inspired by Perl's Moose - and the descriptors that power it.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Fraser Tweedale</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3123/descriptors-attribute-access-redefined-by-fraser</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/54-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/54-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYBVjVEJtEg" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/xYBVjVEJtEg/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Django MiniConf: How to be helped; or, Why is FunkyBob angry with me?</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3120/django-miniconf-how-to-be-helped-by-curtis-malon</link><description></description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Curtis Maloney</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3120/django-miniconf-how-to-be-helped-by-curtis-malon</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/123-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/123-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM0G-3jiBA0" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/VM0G-3jiBA0/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Django MiniConf: Lightning talks</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3121/django-miniconf-lightning-talks</link><description></description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3121/django-miniconf-lightning-talks</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/120-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/120-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoQs_4DO-h4" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MoQs_4DO-h4/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>How (not) to upgrade a platform by Edward Schofield</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3125/how-not-to-upgrade-a-platform-by-edward-schofie</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Guido admitted in his PyCon 2014 keynote that he will never again conduct a language transition like that from Python 2 to Python 3. The vast majority of Python code written in 2014 is still a ``SyntaxError`` on the latest version of Python. Some people have been wondering: will Python 3 ever take off? 

We have done some data mining from PyPI to reveal what progress the community has made so far toward migrating the long tail of packages towards Python 3 and which packages are most critical in the dependency graph of unported packages. We extrapolate from current growth rates about when (if ever) Python 3 support will reach a tipping point after which more new code will be written in Python 3 than Python 2.

We then share our perspective on mistakes made in the Python 3 transition and lessons that we can all learn from. The lessons apply to migrating any interface -- a language, a codebase, or a web API.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Edward Schofield</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3125/how-not-to-upgrade-a-platform-by-edward-schofie</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/50-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/50-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tEcZ8eDKAc" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/7tEcZ8eDKAc/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Lightning talks</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3124/lightning-talks-8</link><description></description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3124/lightning-talks-8</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/66-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/66-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2ppW681A8M" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/J2ppW681A8M/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Serialization formats aren't toys by Tom Eastman</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3128/serialization-formats-arent-toys-by-tom-eastman</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Do you have an API? 

Do you accept input from users? Do you accept it in XML? What about YAML? Or maybe JSON? How safe are you?

Are you sure?

It’s not in the OWASP Top 10, but you don’t have to look far to hear stories of security vulnerabilities involving deserialization of user input. Why do they keep happening?

In this talk I’ll go over what the threat is, how you are making yourself vulnerable and how to mitigate the problem. I’ll cover the features (not bugs, features) of formats like XML, YAML, and JSON that make them surprisingly dangerous, and how to protect your code from them.

Because here’s the thing: If you are using, say, a compliant, properly implemented XML parser to parse your XML, you are NOT safe. Possibly quite the opposite.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom Eastman</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3128/serialization-formats-arent-toys-by-tom-eastman</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/63-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/63-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrW-HSHP0ws" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/LrW-HSHP0ws/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>The Quest for the Pocket-Sized Python by Christopher Neugebauer</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3126/the-quest-for-the-pocket-sized-python-by-christop</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Python's already a language of choice for developers on the web, in science, and on the desktop. In the meantime, the world of Mobile computing has exploded in the last couple of years, and developers targetting Android, iOS, and other Mobile platforms are writing their apps in Java, Objective-C, JavaScript... but definitely not Python.

But Python's a great language for solving the sort of problems that are posed in Mobile development time -- speedy development cycles, 20 years worth of libraries for solving many tasks that you throw at it, and a ready-made community to help developers. So why aren't we using Python?

This talk surveys the current landscape of Python on the major Mobile platforms, and ways you can start targeting Mobile platforms with your Python code. We'll look at considerations for Mobile web development, the state of Python-based mobile toolkits, and progress towards Python-coded native UIs.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Christopher Neugebauer</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3126/the-quest-for-the-pocket-sized-python-by-christop</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/39-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/39-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1neKbS7UZM" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/R1neKbS7UZM/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>What is OpenStack? by Michael Still</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3127/what-is-openstack-by-michael-still</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
OpenStack is one of the biggest python projects ever, and is hiring plenty of interesting python people to work on Open Source, which is cool. Yet, many people tell me that they don't really understand what OpenStack is. Let's fix that once and for all.

25 minutes isn't a long time, so what I'll provide is an overview of the various components of OpenStack and how they tie together. We'll cover what bits might be of interest to your average python hacker, as well as the general problems we're trying to solve. I secretly hope this will enthuse people to come and hack on OpenStack, but its also cool if audience members walk away from the talk deciding that OpenStack is not of interest to them -- so long as they now understand vaguely what OpenStack is, then we're cool.

I'll also try and cover how the OpenStack Foundation and code governance model works, but it might require talking really fast.
