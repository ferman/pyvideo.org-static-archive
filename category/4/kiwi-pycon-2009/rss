Introductory programming with Python

Presented by Brendan McCane

Abstract

In first semester 2009, CS at Otago introduced an introductory programming
course using Python. This talk will describe the course and student outcomes.

Outline

The talk will cover the following topics: - the problems of teaching and
learning programming - does language make a difference? - why Python is a good
choice for a first language - the structure of the course - things that worked
well, and things that didn't - what students thought about it - impact on
learning Java in the second semester - changes for 2010 Note: this is a
preliminary outline, it's likely that it will change somewhat before the
conference.

Computer Vision

Presented by Brian Thorne

Abstract

An introduction to computer vision in Python, from the general concept to its
implementation with some current open-source libraries (opencv, scipy,
pygame).

Outline

The purpose of my presentation is an introduction to computer vision (CV) and
image processing in Python. I will aim to show what is possible with current
libraries, demonstrate their usability, explore their limitations, and cover
elements of best coding practice. Firstly, I will briefly present the basics,
such as video grabbing, image processing and computer vision algorithms. I
will illustrate my presentation with the Python bindings to the opencv library
and show different examples such as displaying a video image, some filtering
algorithms (dilation, gaussian blur), and how to implement facial recognition.
I will describe after how related tasks can be achieved with other Python
tools such as scipy and pygame. I will show how these three libraries can be
used in conjunction to perform video capturing, image processing and user
interfacing. Finally, I will introduce my basic Python computer vision
framework, which is aimed at inexperienced users, and demonstrate it on the XO
laptop, the inexpensive low-powered sub-notebook distributed as part of the
One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative.

pyserf - a shortcut for writing C extensions in C

Presented by Douglas Bagnall

Abstract

There are many clever ways of connecting Python and C code together, and
pyserf is one of those. It is just a short script that parses a module outline
and produces an idiomatic template for a C extension providing the same
signatures, so all you need to do is write the bits that actually do stuff.

Outline

Pyserf is a tiny project that I wrote for my own use years ago and never
released because it is so obvious that dozens of better versions must exist.
The idea is simple -- you write an outline of a module like this:

    
    
    """module documentation"""
    def top_level_function(int_a, float_b):
       "function documentation"
       return float_c
    
    class SomeModule:
       """class documentation"""
       def foo(self, int_ants obj_zoo):
          """method documentation"""
          return float_frogs
    

and pyserf uses the parsing modules in the standard library to generate a C
file that will compile to an extension providing the interface it describes,
with the documentation appearing in the right place and the type conversions
all properly handled. The generated file is not a hideous unreadable mess,
rather it is within a few characters of best practise according to the
official tutorial. Once you have this template, you abandon your outline and
write the middles of each function in C. In describing what pyserf does, this
talk will demonstrate what is required to write an extension in C by hand, and
show you some ways of using the standard libraries parsing modules.

Te Tuhi Video Game System

Presented by Douglas Bagnall

Abstract

Tetuhi is a python program that turns drawings on paper into 2D top-down early
80s style video games. This talk describes how.

Outline

Te Tuhi Video Game System is not a game in itself; rather it creates games
based on arbitrary images that it is given. To use it, you draw a picture of
the game you want to play, and it will give you the game that you really drew.
The software was originally written for an art exhibit using slightly
specialised hardware, but it has been released under the GPL and runs on
ordinary computers. It uses Pygame, PIL, and custom C extensions that allow it
to evolve a playable game from a wide variety of pictures. This talk will
discuss the techniques used (both refined algorithms and hacky heuristics) and
cover topics such as image analysis, machine learning, and interface design.
There will be a demonstration.

Python Data Plotting and Visualization Extravaganza

Presented by Guy Kloss

Abstract

In various fields data is accumulated or produced. This can be observation
data, statistical data, simulation data, ... Information like that can in many
cases be much more easily analysed through the user's eyes employing data
visualisation. This talk is trying to dive briefly into various means and
tools to visually analyse data of different qualities: time series, simple 2D
plots, surface plots, volume plots, quiver plots, etc.

Outline

I am planning on doing a "fly by" through the world of data visualisation for
different types of data using different tools. Types of data:

  * 1D data and simple functions 
  * 2D data for surface plots 
  * 3D data through quiver plots, iso surfaces, and cutting planes 
  * n-D data through different means 
  * continuous and non-continuously structured data 
  * time series 
  * real time data visualisation/analysis 

The tools that will probably appear in the demos and discussions:

  * GNUplot 
  * matplotlib 
  * Mayavi2 
  * Visual Python

Building web animation application with Python-ogre

Presented by Indy Liu

Abstract

In building our online user-customisable animation system, we needed a 3D
engine that is powerful, stable and flexible. We are lucky to have made
python-ogre our choice. Combined with FFMpeg and the boto library, we were
able to build the whole solution in python with as little hassle as possible.

Outline

  * Open source python game engines; 
  * What we need - Not just a game engine; 
  * What you can do with python-ogre; 
  * Combining with other libraries FFMpeg, boto; 
  * Interfacing with the web - celery;

A smart introduction to Plone

Presented by Joel Burton

Abstract

The world of online content management systems has become so enormous that it
can be difficult to weigh the advantages--and disadvantages--of the systems.
The speaker, a noted Plone author and consultant, will demonstrate the
featureset of Plone, and provide real-world hints on the customer value and
challenges it provides.

Outline

Here, you can learn where Plone may serve your needs well, and where it might
be overkill or inappropriately deployed. You'll also learn approximate
budgets, in time and learning, you'd need to get up to speed on the system. In
addition, a demonstration of the upcoming features of Plone 4 and a future-
looking glance at the radically-redesigned Plone 5 will be given. Recommended
for new and casual users of Plone, and for people interested in understanding
its niche in the CMS/application development world.

Testing Demo

Presented by Michael Dunstan

Abstract

Live demo of writing code and tests.

Outline

This live demo is intended for people that have not seen test driven
development in action before. See what a failing test should look like. And
then I'll attempt to write some code to make that test pass so that you can
see what a successful test run looks like - I may need some help from the
audience at that point. Along the way you'll see various features of the test
framework 'nose' in action and even some doctests. This will be a second
attempt of the stunt first performed: [http://nzpug.org/MeetingsAuckland/Augus

An introduction to PyPy

Presented by Michael Hudson-Doyle

Abstract

An overview of the ideas behind the project, its current status, future plans
and why you should care about it.

Outline

The core idea of PyPy is to produce a flexible and fast implementation of the
Python programming language. The talk will cover the interpreter, translator
and jit parts of the code and their relationships and the fundamental ways in
which PyPy differs from other virtual machine implementations.

How we use Twisted in Launchpad

Presented by Michael Hudson-Doyle

Abstract

Launchpad is a large, open source, "real world" Python project with many
moving parts. This talk will explain how Twisted helps us keep track of them.

Outline

Although we don't use it for the core web application, most other places in
Launchpad that have to deal with concurrency issues do it using Twisted. This
talk will survey these areas and talk about issues we've found and design
patterns we've found helpful.

The Living Coder

Presented by Richard Clark

Abstract

Tales, anecdotes philosophy and musings about the life that surrounds the code
we write.

Outline

The project manager called me to his office and said "I know you did this in
two weeks in perl, but applications here must be written in java, because java
programmers are much easier to find". When I left 6 months later, the same
manager said "You wouldn't happen to know any java programmers would you? we
have nobody to replace you..". This is the story of the life that exists
around the code we write.

Tkinter doesn't suck, honest

Presented by Richard Jones

Abstract

In this talk I hope to dispel the myth that Tkinter just plain sucks through
the use of some concrete examples of simple use resulting in effective user
interfaces.

Outline

I intend to cover some basics of getting Tkinter GUIs up and running, and then

Stackless Python 101

Presented by Richard Tew

Abstract

An introduction to Stackless Python, showing what it is useful for and how to
use it.

Outline

The talk would start by describing what Stackless Python is, and the reasons
why you would use it. Next it would cover how to use Stackless Python. And
finally, what the limitations of a green threading framework like this are and
what needs to be done to cater for them.

/me wants it. Scraping sites to get data.

Presented by Robert Coup

Abstract

Building scrapers for grabbing data from websites. Tools, techniques, and
tips.

Outline

Life would be so much easier if the data contained in websites was available
raw via APIs. Alas, until that mythical day comes we either need to deal with
unhelpful people via email and phone, or just get it ourselves. Python has
some great tools available to help with building scrapers and for parsing and
formatting the data we get. Starting off with the basics - tracking what needs
to be done, making web requests, parsing HTML, following links, and
extricating data from Excel and PDF documents. Our scraper needs to be
resilient against too-clever content management systems, Frontpage-era HTML,
and plain dodgy data. We may need to pass through logins and other messiness.
There are some techniques and tips for approaching the problems and keeping
your solution flexible and as simple as possible. We'll discuss some scrapers
built for New Zealand data, and introduce a new project from the NZ open
government data group to provide a RESTful interface to scrapers - effectively
creating a nice API where there isn't one.

Monitoring and debugging your live application

Presented by Robert Coup

Abstract

Ever wondered what is going on inside your app? Learn some tools and ideas you
can use for sussing it out.

Outline

Debugging issues in live applications can be a real nightmare. Add some more
logging, restart it, wait for the failure/load case and try and deduce a bit
more. Even with awesome test coverage you still need to debug those tricky
problems. This talk will introduce some ideas for monitoring and debugging
your live applications. The key things to cover are:

  * the standard logging module and learning how to drive it well. How to log effectively so it makes sense later, and what sorts of things we should be instrumenting and measuring. 
  * how to set up a remote console session into our running application, so we can interrogate variables and run code to figure out what's going on. 
  * how to incorporate IRC or IM bots so we can interact with our apps from the desktop, and how they can interact with us.

Get started with Zope3

Presented by Roman Joost

Abstract

The talk introduces Zope 3, the main differences to Zope (2) and how to get
started.

Outline

The Zope application server exist for nearly a decade now. One of the biggest
changes to the Zope architecture was the rewrite of the framework and an
introduction of a component architecture. Zope 3 was born. The talk covers how
developers can bootstrap a Zope 3 project using buildout, what the differences
between Zope (2) and Zope 3 is, how views and models are created and
registered, how third party applications are used and how common pitfalls can
be avoided.

Grok or how Zope3 reinvented itself

Presented by Roman Joost

Abstract

The talk introduces how to quickly and easily create web applications with
Grok, a web framework based on Zope3
([http://grok.zope.org/](http://grok.zope.org/)).

Outline

Grok is a web application framework based on Zope 3 - the popular application
server. One of the main aspects of Grok is the rapid development of web
applications without losing the flexibility Zope 3 provides. The talk covers a
quick introduction to Zope 3 and Grok. Based on an example, I will provide a
quick walk through on how easy it is to create sophisticated web applications
with Grok. Additionally, the talk outlines pitfalls for newcomers and how to
avoid them.

OLPC XO: Python bringing education to the world's poorest children

Presented by Tim McNamara

Abstract

This topic will be divided into five different area of 10 minutes each, with
time for questions and discussion. We'll talk about the OLPC programme, the
hardware, the software, the educational theory and how to get involved NZ.

Outline

  1. In defence of the OLPC XO This section will be a brief overview of the whole project hopefully with an eye to dispel some rumour and controversy surrounding the project. There has been several mixed messages, and I would like to 
  2. Overview of the hardware In this section, the talk to move into a discussion about the overview of the hardware itself. There will be several machines for the audience to have a look at, and we'll try and test some of the mesh networking, collaboration and sharing capabilities that are built into the machine. 
  3. Overview of the software The OLPC XO is run using a Python environment called Sugar ([http://sugarlabs.org.nz](http://sugarlabs.org.nz/)), which itself is a Fedora Remix. We will talk a little about how an Activity is built and how to start contributing to the Sugar system. 
  4. How to deploy into schools This segment will go over some of the theoretical underpinnings of the user interface and Sugar's approach to things like the directory structure. We'll also explore some of the tools that teachers and parents can use to progressively encourage their children to learn about computing and develop creative and critical thinking. 
  5. How to get involved There are small pockets of XOs around the country. Learn where they are and how to start improving them!
