        <p>Regular expressions are a mini-language used for pattern-matching in text. They have been a staple of the computing world for decades: they are implemented in most programming languages, form the core of several utilities, and can be found lurking in the search-and-replace functionality of any sufficiently advanced text editor.
Despite their usefulness, regular expressions have developed a reputation for complexity and a steep learning curve. New programmers are often warned to steer clear of them -- which is a pity, because there are some problems for which they are a quick and elegant solution.
In this talk I aim to demystify regular expressions for the beginner programmer, and to provide a brief guided tour of Python's re module. I hope to encourage more programmers to get to know this useful tool.</p>

        <p>Computer and computer based activities have pervaded our teaching/learning process as well as research so much so that the 21st century academic activities in science and engineering (S &amp; E) cannot be fully engaged without some level of computation. An important choice of a programming language especially in a developing country is the ease to learn it and its accessibility.
Python's unique features and the possibility that any user connected to the internet can download the entire packages into any platform, install it and immediately begin to use it makes it a preferred environment for introducing students and new beginners to elegant and all purpose programming. Therefore in Africa, the Python African Tour project has been launched and I am coordinating its use in computational Science and Engineering (S &amp; E) code-named Python African Computational Science and Engineering Tour (PACSET).</p>

        <p>My journey from a user of the awesome cookiecutter, to a core member of an awesome += 1 community.
I've learned a lot from the modest and multi-talented @audreyr about leading a community, writing clean cross-platform Python code and putting the B in BFDL.
My talk aims to introduce cookiecutter to a wider audience (if you're at a PyCon and you create new projects, you need to use it) and to chart my progress from the outside to the inside of an open source project.</p>

        <p>We all know writing documentation is an arduous exercise. We all know how useless and frustrating out-of-date or just plain incorrect documentation is. In this talk I'd like to demonstrate how Python can help make writing documentation, keeping it up-to-date and verifying its validity. It can be surprising what happens when other people discover your little-but-well-documented API.
Python has several built-in concepts and standard tools to help making this easier, such as docstrings, help(), Sphinx, Sphinx plugins, Doctests and generating documentation off tests themselves.
I'll focus on not only using Sphinx as a tool, but also on how to structure your application/library/tool so as to make writing accurate documentation as simple as possible.</p>

        <p>Having pushed Ruby to the limits of what it can accomplish in terms of number crunching and data analysis, we looked around for another solution in the data analysis and modelling space. We quickly found that with packages and tools like Numpy, Pandas, the iPython Notebook and new packages like Blaze, Python looked to be a good language fit.
Porting a large existing codebase and accompanying infrastructure from a Ruby to Python ecosystem simply wasn't an option, so we had to do something clever (and fun!).
This talk will be about how we managed to leverage the power of Python while retaining our modelling code in Ruby (and opening up opportunity for other languages), by embracing Lisp’s code-is-data philosophy.</p>

        <p>Twisted is an open source framework for writing network based services. It utilises an asynchronous, event driven model which allows the rapid development of custom network protocols. While Twisted makes implementing network services much easier, it comes with its own set of challenges. One of these challenges involves tracking the context of multiple requests. In a traditional web server the thread ID could be used to track a particular request and modify log entries appropriately. However, this does not work in Twisted as it utilises a single thread (generally speaking).
We have chosen to tackle this issue, amongst others, by monkey patching some of the Twisted subsystems.
Through this talk we will introduce Twisted as a viable option for programming network based services. No previous Twisted knowledge is required, and the concepts introduced will be explained through real world examples of restful controllers implemented in Twisted. This primer will be followed by a discussion on our solution to the context tracking problem as well as some of the other areas in which we have found monkey patching to be beneficial.</p>

        <p>Automated tests are an important part of any software project, but they're often hard to work with. Good test code should be written with its own set of priorities and is sufficiently different from non-test code that many standard programming practices are unsuitable.
I have spent many years writing (and reading) tests of varying quality and have learned quite a lot from the experience. I hope to share some of that experience and help to remove some of the pain usually associated with writing and maintaining tests.
This talk will cover some of the practical aspects of writing good tests for real code, including:
1. Properties of a good test case 2. How to manage setup and teardown 3. Testing interactions between components 4. Some tools and techniques to make testing easier 1. Helpers 2. Verified fakes 3. Recording doubles</p>

        <p>We'd like to show how we're using new instruments and the nimbleness of Python to bring seventy-year-old telescopes into the 21st century.
Our long-term goal is to have the telescopes and associated instruments be remotely operable, easy to use, and robust enough that valuable data is reliably captured and stored.</p>

        <p>This talk is aimed at people who maintain Python libraries and also users of Debian packaged libraries. (Wherever I say Debian in this abstract, it applies to Ubuntu too). The talk should explain a bit about how and why libraries are packaged in Debian, and how to help maintain (or contribute) packages you care about.
We'll cover a bit of history of the Python stacks in Debian and how packaged modules are provided, and who does the work. For context, we'll take a quick detour into Debian packaging in general, and the Debian project's lifecycle.
Debian recently gained a new Python packaging tool, pybuild. This finally makes it easy to package the same library for Python 2, 3, and even PyPy. So, we'll have a look at what it does, and some example packaging.</p>

        <p>Python is great language for developing software that works well in a short time-span. The ability to produce code quickly that is of a reasonable quality is very important in a work environment where productivity is of extreme importance. It would thus seem to be very well suited for usage in a start-up environment.</p>

        <p>One of the ways that changes enter the Python language is via their prior discussion on the python-ideas mailing list. Many core contributors read and contribute to this list, some do not, and a large number of other interested Python programmers also participate in the discussion. A recurring element of these fascinating discussions is that ideas which seem compelling at first blush, upon deeper discussion reveal the greater wisdom of doing things just the way Python already does. Not always, of course, but often.
A wonderful case study of this process is the innocuous seeming built-in 'sum()'. This function has an intricate history, with a great deal of dispute over just what its semantics and performance characteristics can or should be. A particular thread on python-ideas, rich with discussions of use cases and subtle semantics, led both to the creation of the 'statistics' module in Python 3.4 (which contains a "private" version of the function, 'statistics._sum()') and to a rejection of performance "optimizations" when operating over collections of collections (which may or may not seem obvious to "sum" in the first place).</p>

        <p>With the advent of the low cost Raspberry Pi computer, anyone with a soldering iron and some basic Python skills can take everyday objects and transform them into fully networked, smart devices.
In this talk, I will show you how I hacked a Raspberry Pi into my home alarm system, turning my network of IP cameras into motion triggered sensors. I will show you how to build basic input and output circuits and introduce you to the RPi.GPIO Python module. We’ll talk about how you can build a RESTful server on your Raspberry Pi to enable remote access. And finally, more ideas for hacking everyday objects around the home!
No prior electronics knowledge required.</p>

        <p>The Southern African Large Telescope is the premier optical astronomical facility in South Africa. Since the start of science operations in September 2011, it has produced a wide range of scientific results from studies of near-Earth asteroids to galaxies at the edge of the Universe. Once observations are obtained at the telescope, they are passed through our science pipeline, which is built on Python. The pipeline rapidly distributes the data, provides science quality reductions, and monitors the performance of the telescope. In addition, developments made for SALT have also contributed to astropy, a python library for astronomy.
In this talk, we highlight how these developments are helping to contribute to our understanding of the Universe. We describe how we are using python to provide rapid reductions of the observations, for teaching new students, and for solving new problems.</p>

        <p>Millions of people read news monthly, and news tend to happen in bursts. The ideal infrastructure is able to scale up or down as soon as needed and provide a way to let you proactively manage your servers rather than reactively, which in the media game is a deal breaker. It gets even worse when you're running most of the local publication sites, including some big name players.</p>

        <p>Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale, distributed data processing. It offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as well as a rich set of libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics. Spark is currently one of the most exciting and fastest-growing Apache open source projects.
This talk will give an overview of the Apache Spark project and introduce the basics of PySpark, the Python API for Spark. It will then dive a little deeper into PySpark internals, and finally show some examples and a live demo covering PySpark, Spark's SQL engine, and machine learning with Spark's built-in libraries as well as other Python libraries.</p>

        <p>Lightning Talks are fun, short, five-minute (or less) talks. Ideally each talk should make a single point, often in a fun, quirky or over-the-top way.</p>

        <p>Any decent textbook on astrophysics starts with a historical prologue running something like this: "Once upon a time, we believed the earth was flat. We were wrong. Once upon a time, we believed the sun rotated around the earth. We were wrong." It's a shame that computer science textbooks don't start the same way: "Once upon a time, we believed that all computer languages would be statically compiled. We were wrong. Once upon a time, we believed that execution would always be single-threaded, on a single processor, on a single machine. We were wrong." The world of technology is marching on toward ever more concurrent architectures, also called "Cloud", and various other buzzwords. The transition is at once so mundane as to go unnoticed, and so fundamental as to shake the very foundations of computer science. This talk explores the past, present, and future of the "Cloud", and the implications for Python and other open source projects.</p>

        <p>Python is such a beautiful language, and is used as a scripting language in many open source graphical applications. By using the power of Python within Blender, we can easily automate so many things, and make long tedious tasks seem like child's play.</p>
