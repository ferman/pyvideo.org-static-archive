A quick review of graph databases and Python</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3981/are-they-ready-a-quick-review-of-graph-databases</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Graph databases store, retrieve and process data that takes the form of a graph: a network of nodes and the relationships between them. As one of the fastest growing database models over the past two years, they promise a number of fantastic outcomes including increased performance, faster development, and cleaner code. Vendors also boast of large corporate deployments throughout the US and Europe. 

So, are graph databases as good as they sound? How can we use them with Python? 

This talk will review a couple of the most popular graph databases including Neo4J, Titan and OrientDB.   The focus will be on interacting with each database as Pythonically as possible – using Python APIs as much as possible. Along the way it will give an idea of ease of use, speed, documentation quality and stability, as well as any other challenges or tricks that found along the way. It isn’t a tutorial – there’s not enough time, and those exist elsewhere – but instead more of an introduction to what is out there and what you can do with it. 

At the end of the talk, you will have an idea of what it takes to get started with Graph Databases in Python, and also an idea of which toolset you want to use. You’ll also have an idea of the sorts of problems which map well to graph databases, and which ones may be better suited to other storage and processing methods. 

You won’t need to have a background in graphs or even a lot of Python experience to get through this talk. However, it’s always good to have a potential application in mind.

The ``cryptography`` library emerged in 2014 with the goal of
becoming Python's "cryptographic standard library".  It is designed
to be easy to use but flexible, exposing a *recipes* layer for
common use cases, and a *hazmat* layer that provides crypto
primitives but demands users know what they're doing in order to use
them properly.

This talk will explain the motivations and goals of the
``cryptography`` library, take a tour of its features and discuss
its implementation.  ``cryptography`` will be compared to some other
popular and emerging crypto libraries.  Finally, we will examine
some real-world use of the library.

Audience members should have a passing familiarity with cryptography
(e.g. know the differences between hashing and encryption, or public
key and private key crypto) to get the most out of this talk.

What happens when you feel some syntax or behaviour is missing from Python? You could fork the interpreter, but then nobody else could run your programs. Instead, you could implement the new behaviour as a Python module to be imported, and distribute it with your programs.

Following hot on the tracks of previous Pycon-AU talks like "Don't Do This" (2013) and the "ugly hacks" bit of "Here be dragons: some elegant and ugly hacks in CPython" (2014), this presentation will grant some of the requests you never dared to make:

- You'd like for PEP 336, Make None Callable to have succeeded? You can make your own None()! Easy in CPython with CTypes!

- You'd like to have the "?." operator available for safe attribute access? Just add the syntax to pypy, then use a source codec hack to rewrite it into a legal Python 2.7 function. Too easy!

- Your reaction to all of this is “please make it stop”? The talk will finish by discussing why having extensible syntax as a standard Python feature might even be a good idea! It is in other languages!

This talk is for intermediate to advanced Python users, and for beginning Python implementors.

OpenStack listens to requests over the network, and (when appropriate) performs operations on the host that require root superpowers.  Following best-practice design, most of the code runs as an unprivileged user and only the code that needs additional powers runs as root using a tool called "rootwrap".

This talk discusses the evolution that led to the current rootwrap design, why it has proven to be completely inadequate in practice, and presents a new "privsep" alternative currently being worked on within Oslo.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Angus Lees</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4034/privsep-a-new-security-isolation-mechanism-for-o</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FOQB4PZVe0" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0FOQB4PZVe0/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Wax On, Wax Off: The Tough Love Guide to Mentoring</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4002/wax-on-wax-off-the-tough-love-guide-to-mentorin</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Everyone has more bugs than they can fix, more features they would like than time to write them. Wouldn't it be great to have some help? The problem is who knows enough about what you know to actually provide help the way you need?

Open Source has lots of fans and supporters, but many newcomers need the warmth of a person caring about their existence to actually turn them into a contributor.

Someone sees you working, is enamoured of what you do and wants to learn. You could break down the steps of what you are doing and get them to follow those steps, that is teaching.

You could recognize the deep inner understanding the is the foundation of your behaviour. You could decide to help someone build such a foundation for themselves. That is mentoring.

Mentoring is helping someone to fail and learn from it. Mentoring is about witnessing someone else's journey, whereever they go, whereever it takes them and saying I'm here, I'm with you, I'm watching. Mentoring is 99% listening.

Mentoring is much more time consuming than teaching. Teaching helps someone learn a skill, mentoring helps someone learn themselves.

Now don't get me wrong, teaching is great and we need teachers and to be taught plus many great teachers can also be mentors. Teaching and mentoring are different.

This talk will discuss mentoring.

With examples drawn from learning acupuncture, yoga, astrology, pottery, working on film sets, heavy equipment operating as well as code, Anita will endeavour to share what she has learned about mentoring. She hopes you will take away the ability to recognize the difference between teaching and mentoring. She also hopes that should you decide to mentor you have some resources to help you strengthen your mentoring skills.

Azrael is a game engine for engineers. Unlike traditional engines it emphasises
accurate physics, runs in the Cloud, offers a language agnostic API, and is written in (mostly) Python.

Its main purpose is to make it easy for engineers to build, study, and control
complex physical systems, for instance how to auto pilot a space ship; or a fleet
thereof; in formation; through an Asteroid belt...

I will show a live demo to illustrate the concept. It uses a simple control
algorithm to manoeuvre an object to a pre defined position in space. Once there
it will maintain that position despite random collisions with other objects.

Any modern business generates a lot of logs - from customer transactions all the way to the technical logs of your servers. Many times these logs are thrown away or just sit uselessly somewhere on disk.

I would like to show you how you can make sense of all that data, how to collect and clean them, store them in a scalable fashion and, finally, explore and search across various systems.

Once we have all the data in one place I will go over some examples of more advanced analysis (beyond simple, though very useful, counting of things) like finding patterns and trends in your data.

We will use Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana (aka the ELK stack) to achieve that. All tools presented are open source and examples will be using real life use cases.

pip has become an immensely popular tool for installing packages in Python, so much so that a bootstrap mechanism for it is now included in the standard library. But it has a dark side. Come and learn about some of the horrors that lurk within pip. Examples will include the distribute -] setuptools fork and convergence, dealing packages which attempt to use not-yet-installed dependencies, and the oh-man issue of resolving dependencies which pip still entirely punts on.

Scikit-learn's Random Forests are a great first choice for tackling a machine-learning problem. They are easy to use with only a handful of tuning parameters but nevertheless produce good results. Additionally, a separate cross-validation step can be avoided using the out-of-bag sample predictions generated during the construction of the forest, and finally they make it relatively easy to identify and extract the most important features of the sample data.

In this talk we’ll go through the process of using scikit-learn’s random forests using a financial data-set (of ASX equities) as an example. We’ll begin with a basic overview of the random forest algorithm and of the tuning parameters available and their impact on the effectiveness of the forest. Secondly we’ll go over the basic usage of scikit-learn’s random forests and in the process trouble-shoot some common problems such as dealing with missing sample data. Next we’ll discuss the use of out-of-bag sample predictions as a method for quickly performing cross-validation and optimising the tuning parameters. Finally we’ll look at how to extract information from the model that scikit-learn has generated, most notably the relative importances of the features in the sample data.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Gregory Saunders</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4051/adventures-in-scikit-learns-random-forest</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkVscKsV_qk" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YkVscKsV_qk/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>An End-to-End Machine Learning Ecosystem in a Quarter</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4063/an-end-to-end-machine-learning-ecosystem-in-a-qua</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Building a machine learning model is hard. Building and serving individual machine learning models for thousands of customers every single day is harder. Model training time must be kept to a minimum, memory constraints are exacerbated and the love and insight that one would usually apply to refining a single model must be automated and scaled. At Zendesk we successfully use pandas, scikit-learn, flask and hadoop to run a machine learning ecosystem that builds, tunes and serves account specific models via an API for many of our customers. This talk is about what we learnt building it and how Python's data stack let us get it to production really really fast.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Chris Hausler</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4063/an-end-to-end-machine-learning-ecosystem-in-a-qua</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=of6pHdSbtOM" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/of6pHdSbtOM/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Ansible, Simplicity, and the Zen of Python</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3967/ansible-simplicity-and-the-zen-of-python</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Ansible is a configuration management tool, written in Python, that has taken the world of IT automation by storm. Its most remarkable quality is simplicity.

The Zen of Python is a set of aphorisms which capture the design philosophy of the Python language, one being "Simple is better than complex".

In this talk, we’ll look at some of the concrete ways that Ansible embodies the Zen of Python, in an attempt to unravel the true meaning of the sometimes cryptic aphorisms. Along the way we will consider why simplicity is a such good thing, yet tantalisingly out of reach in most software projects.

Ever tried to get into data science or machine learning, but struggled with getting your tech stack working, or found the maths off-putting? Curious about the limits of what your laptop or desktop really are when it comes to Big Data and predictive analytics? Ever wondered if these tools were really accessible to a general developer?

Note: Attendees should consider visiting the project URL for instruction to get set up ahead of time. The will allow more time for coding, although setup assistance will also be available on the day.

This tutorial will provide attendees with a walkthrough on getting set up for this work, and an overview of a good tech stack / software ecosystem for beginning work. We'll cover some of the standard data sets in machine learning, and how to apply interesting algorithms. Random Forests and neural networks will be included, but with a minimum of fuss and jargon. There will be a focus on the application of technology, with only the most relevant theoretical aspects included. This is about actually getting things done.

This tutorial would be suitable for intermediate developers of any background, or experienced developers who would like an introduction to data science that gets to the point fast. Prerequisites: the ability to install Python modules on your laptop, the ability to set up a new virtual environment, and an interest in applying new techniques.

The tutorial will include clear walkthroughs, as well as allowing adequate time for discussion and individual learning. Please contact Tennessee via email ahead of time if you would like to get a head start on setting up your environment -- this may help you get more out of the tutorial.

The potential upside of microservices is significant and exciting. So much so that Yelp's Transaction Platform committed from the start to an architecture of small, cooperative microservices. This talk explores the inevitable complications that arise in successful projects based on microservices as they grow larger and stretch both their own architecture and the developers responsible for them. Come hear tales of terror (tight coupling! low test coverage!), stories which will warm your heart (agility! strong interfaces!), and everything in between as we follow the adventures of our plucky team.

The talk will be focused on the functional, cultural, and reliability challenges which occur as a microservices-based project evolves and expands over time. Particular attention will be paid to where these diverge from the utopian way microservices are often described, and to the practical approaches your project can take to mitigate issues and avoid the traps inherent in scaling up this type of approach. My goal is to share with attendees some mistakes we've made, some successful methods for growing gracefully, and above all with useful (and maybe unexpected!) lessons from the trenches they can apply to their own work.

Say you have this piece of software that many people use. One day, you wake up and you have the urge to make them suffer. Well, there’s no better way to do so than breaking the software they’re using.

In this talk, I’ll walk you through very good ways to do so by showing examples taken from experience - because experience is the only thing that matters (TM) - so that you’ll be able, by the time this talk ends, to do the same to your users.

(P.S: If you’ve a kinder hearth, you can also do the exact opposite of what I’ll say and keep your users happy.)

We have many ways of reporting and recognising our code contributions in open source projects, but often it is the work we do outside of code commits themselves that get forgotten and unattributed. Hours of code review, documentation, testing; organising of meetups and volunteering at conferences; even just brainstorming and talking about things - how much of these have you done without accreditation? 

During this session, we will discuss what it means to contribute to open source projects, what constitutes a non-code contribution, steps we can take to recognise the work of our peers, and how projects can better encourage non-code participation through recognition and acknowledgement.

There are several (open source and proprietary) packages available for image processing in neuroscience. However, each package has its own strengths and limitations depending on the purpose of the analysis. After testing many of them at work, we have found a need to develop our own packages (at the Brain Imaging Laboratory, MBC). We will expose a couple of python tools that could be handy for anyone dealing with neuroscience (or medical images in general) in their projects. The tools presented are for (i.) quick image viewing, (ii.) dicom image sorting and de-identifying and (iii.) automatic email notifications to alert about server warnings (e.g., if machine is down, close to full capacity, failing to connect to local image archiving network (PACS), etc..). While many of these tools could have been written in other programming languages, we will explain the reasons for choosing python, share a bit about our python learning journey and perform a brief demonstration on the command line.

Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. This allows for rapidly deployable apps, which will run on any docker environment with the ability to rapidly scale.

As Docker is based on Linux containers, these are very lightweight and allow resource isolation. With added tools to provide workflow automation and image management, Docker can provide a complete toolset to manage your application environment.

Aimed at newcomers to the technology, this talk will cover the basics of what Docker is, how it compares to other technologies and with why it's useful for Python applications. There will be practical demos and examples of real world Python deployments included.

Dependency injection (DI) is a technique most often used in "big OO" languages like Java and C#. It's usually dismissed by Python developers as only needed because of these other languages' deficiencies: static typing, restrictive object systems, lack of reflection, etc.

However, there are other dynamically-typed languages which do use forms of dependency injection. From looking at these systems, we can see there are some advantages to dependency injection _even if_ you're not using a traditional "big OO" language with static types and interfaces. Dependency-injected code can be more modular, much easier to test, easier to analyse, and easier to modify or extend to meet new requirements.

Despite this, there aren't many dependency-injection systems for Python. The few that do exist aren't "Pythonic", or implement DI in ways that compromise a lot of its benefits.

Fang is a library which adds dependency injection to Python in a way which provides real benefits for code clarity, ease of testing, and maintainability, while still fitting naturally into Python's idioms. Fang describes dependencies concisely but explicitly, and doesn't restrict the developer to a particular paradigm on how dependencies are validated or met.

This talk will give a brief overview of how DI is used across a few languages (both traditional OO and dynamic languages) and highlight what elements of DI can be beneficial in Python. The talk will then demo how Fang can be used to add DI to Python code, and show some of the benefits to code clarity, unit testing and code analysis.

Bayesian models are often more useful than classical statistical models when dealing with data concerning rare events in small populations. For example, if you are looking at the number of cancer diagnoses in a local government area, Bayesian models allow you to combine the individual and population level data to produce more reliable estimates. 

Fitting these models can be both complex and computationally expensive, so we need it to be fast. Some of the datasets we deal with are extremely big, and the need for both tweaking and regular update cycles means we need to re-run the models frequently.

But beauty is also crucial. We need the package to be easy to code and describe, so that the statisticians and scientists we work with can build, maintain and understand their own models without needing to refer to programmers. We don’t want a statistical black box. 

Finally, we need it to be easy. Easy to fit into our systems; technology-agnostic so we can change systems; and automatable so that the regular work of updating models with new data can happen ‘hands off’.  

There are a number of Bayesian modelling packages available, but how do you know which one to use? This talk will take you through the positives and negatives of the major packages, focusing on the specifics of my work in health statistics, as well as providing a general overview of what these packages can do.

When you say “hash function” in a room full of Python developers, people tend to think of the classics you get in hashlib: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-OHGODPLEASESTOP, and the like — cryptographic hash functions intended for cryptographic uses.

There’s another world out there, though: non-cryptographic hashes. Sometimes you just need to figure out if you’ve already seen a string or structure. Sometimes you need a basic checksum. Sometimes you need a hash that’s just fast and can fit into a 32 bit integer.

I’ll run through the state of the art in the world of non-cryptographic hashing — what your best options are, how they compare in terms of CPU and memory usage, and how they work. Who takes it? Whose mixing function reigns supreme?

Let’s find out.

* I’m saying “four”, but realistically I’m going to cover as many modern options as I can fit into the time available. Let’s say “four plus two or minus one” in reality.

More and more governments around Australia and the world are starting to talk the talk on Open Data as an essential component of open government.  But to what extent do they walk the walk?  CKAN based data repositories like data.gov.au (at the Australian federal level) provide powerful APIs for searching and discovering published data-sets, but at the end of all that search and discovery, the data-sets themselves sometimes make it clear that somebody somewhere has missed the point.

In developing dashboard applications for state and federal government agencies over the past 6 months, I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly not only in terms of API design and data set presentation, but also in terms of commitment to Open Data.

Zuul is a program that is used to gate the source code repositories of a project so that changes are only merged if they pass tests.

By gating we mean a more proactive continuous integration suite whereby tests must pass in order to merge (rather than a traditional CI that just gives a nightly status of the master branch). This means every commit is tested both during review time and before it merges - in case the repositories have changed in the mean time.

The result of using a gating system like zuul is that it's much harder to break trunk and your nightly builds should nearly always work.

Zuul can be configured to react to events and run various jobs with success or failure results depending on the scenario. Currently Zuul is only integrated with the gerrit code review platform but there are discussions about extending it to github.

One unique and powerful feature in Zuul is its ability to run tests in a predictive manner across multiple programs. Zuul predicts what multiple repositories will look like by the time the present job is finished and arranges the tests to be performed in that order. This stops race conditions when merging code in one repository that depends on code in another repository.

Zuul can manage thousands of jobs across hundreds of projects as evident by being the gate keeper for OpenStack.

In this talk we will look at what Zuul is, how to configure it and the internals of how it works.

Understanding the control flows in programs can be simple but increasingly difficult once the program becomes more complex. Debugging these programs can become problematic even worse with a meager amount of test coverage. So what to do? Increasing test coverage can cost you quite a lot of time and may not necessarily yield better results.

Using slicing as a technique for debugging programs aids to understand control flow better. A slice is a subset of the program which affects the values of the point of interest, also known as a slicing criterion. Using program slicing, reasoning about your code will become much quicker and easier as you can safely ignore any not relevant parts of the program.

This talk is about building a slicing tool for Python and the journey to this solution.

Most Django developers are familiar with authentication and
authorisation on the open web, but the requirements and technologies
used inside companies and large organisations are different:

- Identities and groups are probably stored in an external identity
  management system's directory rather than in an application's
  database tables.

- Authorisation decisions will be based on group membership and
  policies that are defined outside the application.

- Users may be expected or required to use a *single sign-on*
  technology such as Kerberos or SAML to authenticate to applications.

This talk will familiarise the audience with these technologies
and demonstrate how Django applications can be integrated
with an identity management system to meet business
requirements while providing a positive user experience.  Particular
technologies covered will include:

- FreeIPA: an open-source identity management solution, for defining
  users, groups and authorisation policies

- mod_auth_gssapi / mod_auth_kerb: Apache modules for Kerberos
  authentication

- mod_lookup_identity: Apache module to retrieve user information
  from a directory

The talk will conclude with discussion about upcoming Kerberos
features, techniques for dealing with multiple authentication
methods, and progress in making identity management integration
easier for Django developers.

People developing or deploying Django applications in business
environments or for large open source projects with centralised
identity management will get the most out of this talk.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Fraser Tweedale</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4042/integrating-django-with-identity-management-syste</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhcotmeioT8" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HhcotmeioT8/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Interactive visualization for the curious</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3995/interactive-visualization-for-the-curious</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The workhorse plotting tool in Python for most of this century has been Matplotlib. It is stable, powerful, and comprehensive. But the plots it produces are (mostly) lifeless.

The web is now emerging as a superior visualization platform to traditional GUI backends, thanks to SVG, HTML5 Canvas, and WebGL, the speed and quality of modern browsers, and an explosion of high-quality visualization libraries in JavaScript. But what is the Python developer to do? Can we drive these browser-based capabilities from Python?

Thankfully, several recent Python projects are making progress toward this goal -- including MPLd3, Bokeh, and VisPy. These each have different goals and make different design decisions, but all three offer obvious advantages: being able to publish visualizations that users can interact with to extract more meaning from data.

This talk will give shiny demos and review these newer projects thoroughly vis-a-vis other libraries to help you decide whether, or when, to adopt one of them as your go-to visualization library. We will answer these questions: How does the performance compare? Would you need to rewrite all your plotting code? What would it take to integrate Bokeh or VisPy well with the current ecosystem of Python plotting libraries and data analysis tools? What is on the horizon for the different projects? Where do the Jupyter project's interactive widgets fit into this picture?

Come to hear a critical review about the past, present, and future of interactive visualization in Python.

Projects tend to grow, expand and reshape as they progress, this can lead to; high code maintenance, legacy code and feature addition fatigue. Implementing a well-documented and malleable software architecture is a major step in addressing these associated time sinks. This talk will discuss viable software architecture approaches – while demonstrating core python modules, concepts and design patterns from a big data perspective.

Many projects welcome code addition from third party developers, however a well thought out software architecture should not be modified without; review, testing, possible cascading code and documentation changes. To remove the additional complexity of reviewing and handling third party code, designing and offering secure plugin infrastructure can allow for outside additions without the overhead. 

A big data visualisation python project utilised by Oxford and Cambridge universities will be used in code demonstrations to show the direct use of a project built with architecture design in mind, and a multi-level dynamic plugin infrastructure. Attendees will be provided with a clear understanding of how function documentation techniques (PEP-3107 &amp; PEP-0484) can be utilised for class clarity and how to (re)design a code base to allow for integration of third party code, while providing a concise framework for code inclusion. 

Areas covered in this talk include

• Python 3.4 focused
• Project architecture design
• Abstract classes
• Plugin frameworks
• Documentation frameworks
• Type hinting &amp; Function annotations  
• Class method decorators
• Code validation
• Image manipulation

RESTful APIs reign supreme! No longer do developers have to put up with SOAP
and XML-RPC and those bulky, schema laden exchanges. JSON maps almost directly
to python and we're flying again!

Over time the chaos of free form JSON representations has subsided and a number
of best practices have appeared such that we now expect certain patterns when
encountering a new JSON REST API. The next step is to standardize these
practices and start offering the predictability and code reuse we lost years
ago.

The talk will provide an overview of current attempts at standardizing JSON
exchanges such as jsonapi, jsonhome and jsonschema.

Making use of the latest database for your data is considered trendy and edgy, with vendors promising unrealistic expectations when it comes to capabilities of these systems. Furthermore, communities such as Hacker News enforce the idea that you must use the latest and coolest technology in order to be a ‘rockstar’ engineer.

Marketing buzzwords like ‘real-time’, ‘distributed’, ‘high-availability’, and ‘schemaless’ impact our design decisions, and the expectation for applications to be ‘scalable’ often forces developers to prematurely introduce complexity and anti-patterns into their applications by making use of these untested and immature data stores.

Forget about adding the latest trendy data store into your stack; just use Postgres.

This talk will explore the capabilities of Postgres 9.4, and various use-cases where you can involve it as your primary datastore. I will cover some of the projects at Heroku where we have used Postgres, such as:

- Quickly querying over 300M records to get a list of all users on a particular server at a particular point in time.
- Providing almost real-time aggregations of all Heroku customer’s usage.
- Joining 3 different tables on 3 different database servers without any external code.
- Creating a ‘social graph’ of all of Heroku’s users based on commonly used IP addresses.
- Ensuring that coupon codes are used only once, preventing attackers from exploiting ‘race condition’ bugs.

 In particular, I will focus on topics such as:

- Storing, indexing, and querying schemaless data.
- Materialized Views.
- NOTIFY/LISTEN.
- Storing and querying time-series data.
- Updatable views.
- Foreign tables.
- Recursive views.
- Stored functions.
- Range Types
- Partitioning and Sharding data.

Each topic will include links to sample schemas and iPython notebooks so you can take these examples home with you.

Karaage is an open source Python/Django application for managing users and projects on HPC clusters. It is being used in production in a number of sites across Australia. This talk will discuss turning a messy legacy software base into a modern software platform that is much a cleaner mess ("gardening"). I will also talk about some of the lessons learnt along the way, including things that went well, and things that could have been handled better.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian May</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4040/karaage-gardening</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yiiwcntx5M" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9yiiwcntx5M/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Learn You a Flask</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3951/learn-you-a-flask</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Flask is a Python web framework that is both lightweight and powerful. With an active community, and a diverse and versatile choice of plugins, Flask allows you to scale from simple single-URL websites through to highly complex website architectures. 

In this talk we will begin by setting up a simple Flask powered website and get it running on the Heroku PaaS. We will then demonstrate how to integrate Flask and SQLAlchemy (a powerful ORM) to allow database access and get this uploaded and working on Heroku as well.

Finally we will discuss some more advanced concepts and review a number of the Flask plugins to get you started on the path to building great web-based projects.

Lrparsing is a fast, well documented and tested parsing infrastructure for Python. Parsing infrastructures are used when the input to be parsed is too complex to be done by regular expressions alone. Parsing infrastructures are ideally suited to parsing programming languages and configuration files. Lrparsing is roughly equivalent to the combination of Flex and Bison, except completely implemented in Python, and is thus very Pythonic.

The rest of the abstract uses the following Python snippet as an example:

1 if option else 2

lrparsing provides both a lexer (which breaks the input down into tokens, e.g.:

 ['1', 'if' , 'option',  'else', '2']

and a parser generator, which produces a concrete parse tree:

(«ternary», («bool», 'option'), («expr», '1')), («expr», '2')))

 Lrparsing provides Pythonic syntax support to easily construct parsers for programming languages, Domain Specific Languages and configuration file formats.

Lrparsing is very well suited to constructing Concrete Parse Trees but has little support for creating Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), which are much easier to use: My work has added Abstract Syntax Tree support to lrparsing, yielding exactly the same AST nodes that the Python AST module supports:

IfExp(condition, 1, 2)

This talk will give an overview of the major features of Lrparsing, then look at my work to add AST support.

This talk is about an alternative Django ManyToManyField implementation that uses (abuses?) PostgreSQL's full-text search engine instead of an intermediary table to store its relationships. As well as showing off some handy things you can do with this field, we'll talk along the way about full-text search in Postgres, inverted indexes, and how Django's ManyToManyField is implemented.

Behind the scenes, ManyToManyField uses an intermediary table to record its relationships – a classic relational database technique you most likely mastered in Databases 101. But to believe some present-day commentators, classic relational databases with their fixed schemas and their ACID habit belong back in the 70s where they came from.

Enter Postgres, the hip, switched-on parent who works as a public defender and gets on uncomfortably well with your friends. Postgres builds on a wealth of relational history while embracing modern non-relational ideas in a thoughtful, sane way.

In this talk, we'll press full-text search, one of Postgres' repertoire of many useful features, into a service it performs remarkably well despite being designed for quite a different purpose. Code and benchmarks provided!

MidoNet is a Software Defined Networking solution that's currently integrated with OpenStack, Eucalyptus and Docker. We open sourced in November last year and we’re working hard to build a strong community around it.

This presentation will cover MidoNet's core concepts, what distinguishes it from other SDN solutions, its core design and why you would choose it for your project/business. Or not. I'll also discuss some of the cool features that we're currently working on, especially around Multi-site Federation.

You’ll be introduced to concepts like Topology Aware Switches and JIT Datapath flow computation as well as our distributed agent model. You’ll learn why we strongly believe in having intelligent switches and how this impacts the overlay topology definition as well as the Network Function Virtualization implementation.

Most importantly, we hope you'll head over to midonet.org and take it for a spin.

Monads shouldn't be difficult to understand. This talk aims to show what monads are, and why you shouldn't be afraid of them. You most likely use them already (yes, really). 

In this talk, I'll touch briefly on category theory (don't worry, it's not scary), and a couple of practical implementation of monads. You don't have to be a functional programmer or a Haskeller to use monads.

Lastly I shall attempt to lay out a good rationale to use more monads when programming in Python

Free software advocates talk about two types of "Free": Free as in freedom, and Free as in beer. While Free (as in freedom) software is unquestionably better for users and developers alike, Free (as in beer) software doesn't pay the bills. 

Talk to any prominent open source developer, and amongst the success stories, you'll also hear some consistent troubles - that they've got great ideas and grand plans, but no time to execute; that they're about to burn out due to the pressues of maintaining their project; or that they've had yet another mailing list discussion with someone who doesn't understand they're a volunteer. All of these problems stem from a fundamental disconnect: the discrepancy between the clear demand for a software product, and the ability to convert that demand into time needed to service that demand - and that means money.

So is there a way to pay the piper? Or is open source doomed to eek out an existence at the edges of "a real job"?

Are you a scientist who's can't get work done because you the tools you need aren't available?  Do your collaborators use a different computing platform to you?  Are you struggling to find anyone who can help you solve your software integration problems?

These challenges occur because scientists face some of the most difficult challenges in computing  - dealing new and diverse problems;  working with prototypes and legacy systems; collaborating with domain experts, rather than software experts; all while delivering on time with minimal resources. 

Python has a reputation for being a language that excels at "glueing" different systems together in a style that is both easy to understand, test and maintain. More importantly using Python is one way to make sure that you spend your time working on research, rather than coding and debugging.

This presentation will demonstrate some of the skills needed to integrate software from other languages into the Python Scientific computing ecosystem using subprocesses, ctypes, cython the Jupyter project - and what do do when none of these approaches are the right.

Design Patterns, standard designs and idioms in Python

Pythonic (Noun): Uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the language.

Even though you’re using Python syntax and keywords, your code still smells like C, Java or Perl. Or just feels like it's not the best way. This tour of Python is about changing the way you think, and to write Python that makes the best use of the language. As a result, your Python will be cleaner, simpler, nicer, and be more readable.

Even though you know the syntax to make a class and inherit, you don't know when you should. Composition? IsA, HasA, IsLikeA? What about factories, singletons, iterators and adapters?

Mashing together a long and painful background of C, C++, Perl and Java coding, a mind-expanding trip down the Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software rabbit hole, and over 30 years programming experience, Peter brings some clarity, reason and ideas on Pythonic idioms and OO design as implemented in Python.

OpenStack as a phenomenon has been explosive and rather unprecedented. The highly decentralized decision making coupled with an aggressive release cadence have allowed us to be both an inclusive body and also ship software. However, crisp vision is not necessarily an emergent property of collective thought process. It's time for some vision to be presented and championed if we're going to take the next step in our evolution.

Let's talk about a vision of what OpenStack needs to be, how it needs to be shaped, and what it will take to get us there.

While we've made a great big hoopla over the last few years about deploying OpenStack and what our development process is and other fascinating topics, it turns out that a cloud is not particularly interesting in and of itself. A cloud is a thing that you use to, well, DO something.

The OpenStack Infra team DO something with OpenStack clouds every day. It turns out it is related to both developing and deploying OpenStack, but let's forget about that for now. What we really are is a giant machine for manipulating OpenStacks, and we've gotten rather good at it. As a result of that ... we've been good little hackers and have produced a library, called shade, which is the embodiment of the knowledge we've gathered in trying to do useful things. shade is at the heart of our nodepool project, as well as the basis of the latest set of Ansible modules for OpenStack.

So - Let's talk about shade. And let's talk about Ansible. And let's talk about using clouds to actually perform work.

The unfortunate truth about networked applications is that an attacker only needs to know one thing you didn't know to get past your defenses. You need to know everything, they don't.

The odds aren't in your favour. You're eventually going to get hacked.

That's the bad news. But if you stop thinking about a security compromise as that thing you close your eyes and hope never happens", and instead start thinking about it as an inevitability, then you can start making better security decisions.

"If they compromise my web servers, how do I protect my application servers?"

"If they break my application server code, how can I prevent them from gaining a foothold on my infrastructure?"

"If they poison my web-site with cross-site scripting, how do I find out before my users get hurt?"

In short: "If I’m going to get hacked, how do I make it hurt less?"

This is a talk about defense in depth.

Building a secure system isn’t about luck, it’s about planning.

There is plenty of data out there to allow us to create good predictions – the key is getting it in the right format and building the right model.

In this talk we will go through importing data from the net, cleaning it up, creating new features, and building a predictive model. We then evaluate how well we did, using recent NBA data. The model we use will be a decision tree ensemble called a random forest.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Robert Layton</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4061/predicting-sports-winners-using-data-analytics-wi</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7hSD_-gWMw" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k7hSD_-gWMw/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Python for less than $7</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3954/python-for-less-than-7</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
You can now run Python 3.4 on microcontrollers that cost less than a cup of coffee (in a up-market Parisian restaurant :)

MicroPython (http://www.micropython.org/) is a very active port of Python 3 to low-end microcontrollers with minimal RAM (eg. 192k RAM, yes: "k", as in kilobytes) but lots of useful I/O.

Learn how to set up a very cheap microcontroller with wifi and a range of I/O and then program it with MicroPython.

The live demos are guaranteed to fail in spectacular ways as all live demos do, but will hopefully show enough blinking lights to tempt you to leave your i7 hyperthreaded clusters and join the cute but very practical world of cheap, embedded Python.

Over the last 5-10 years, the "desktop/server" split that dominated computing in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s has been joined by a third player - mobile devices such as phones and tablets.

So, what is the story for running Python on these devices? Although there hasn't been much to say in the past, the good news is that over the last year, there's been some signficant changes in the landscape, and Python on Mobile is now teetering on the brink of being a genuine reality.

In this talk, Russell Keith-Magee will survey the current state of using Python on mobile devices, the work that is currently being done, areas where more work is requried, and the prospects for the future.

Depending on who you ask, PEP 484's Type Hints are either the next big thing in Python, or the harbinger of doom upon our entire community. Which is it?

Allowing optional static typing in Python will bring with it some benefits that other languages have had for years: IDEs will be able to do code completion better; a whole class of boring tests will fall out automatically; and some bugs will be easier to catch. 

But this is also undeniably a huge change of direction: will it mean you have to substantially change your code style? Will Python's simple expressiveness suddenly become unattainable thanks to clumsy Java-style type declarations?

To show how PEP 484's Gradual Typing system works, we're going to look at TypeScript, a minimal implementation of Gradual Typing over JavaScript. We'll see how the type system works, and how it fits into the already thriving JavaScript developer community, where most people aren't using type hints at all.

We'll draw some parallels with how Python's implementation will work, and see what Python can learn from a language that has successfully made the jump to a type-hinted world.

"Ugh, why does Unicode have to be so complicated? It's just text, why can't it be as simple as writing a note for myself?"

One of the more controversial changes in Python 3 is the decision to handle text data entirely as Unicode code points. In this presentation, CPython core developer Nick Coghlan will explore some of the background of that design decision, the capabilities it grants Python 3 over Python 2, and some of the related features of the upcoming Python 3.5 release.

This is teamwork and rapid prototyping challenges on steroids. Imagine 15 high school kids, most of whom have only just learned to program, working together to design and build a fully functional social networking site in 3 days. 

This project is done as part of the NCSS (National Computer Science School) summer program. NCSS has been running for 20 years, and I've been involved in the last 7, so that's 6 different social networking sites (we used to build search engines, but apparently they're not cool anymore).

I'll go through the technical details, the tools we use, how the site functions, and how we structure the different pieces to come together. I'll also show off some extra fun projects we throw at the advanced kids, like building their own Django-like template engine, and secure hashing of passwords.

A lot of the challenge of this undertaking is inevitably also project management and coordination of the team. These students have never written tests before, don't know what version control is and don't understand what it means to agree on an API. Hilarity and frustration can (and does) ensue, especially during the last night, which is an all-nighter.

Come along to learn how to do project management with the least experienced team possible and how to hack together a functional prototype webapp with minimum effort.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Katie Bell</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4058/rapid-prototyping-with-teenagers</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOnnjPQzXg8" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gOnnjPQzXg8/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Realtime websites with Django and Meteor</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3971/realtime-websites-with-django-and-meteor</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

pip freeze files and similar techniques like buildout have been used for reliable testing and reliable deployments for some time. But they are not flexible enough to deal with situations like OpenStack where there are dozens of separate codebases, evolving independently, which still need the same rigour and reliability.

Enter pip constraints, new in 7.1.0. I will cover their use, design, and how we're using them in devstack (and thus OpenStack CI) - and how you can (and should) use them in your local projects.

Here, we’ll talk about a better way of code reuse and introducing alternate behaviour into existing classes — composition. It’ll improve how you test your code — making your test runs faster, making it easier to test exceptional cases, and making everything easier to understand.

The Software Carpentry Foundation is an international volunteer organisation that teaches basic programming skills to researchers in science, engineering, medicine and other disciplines. Further, the foundation maintains a wealth of open-source, open-access teaching materials for a several programming related topics, including Python, the Unix shell, Git, SQL, R and Matlab. 

Lessons from Software Carpentry are usually delivered in the form of two day workshops. Taught by trained instructors, these workshops cover automation of repetitive tasks using the shell, building modular and testable programs using Python or R and using version control to build software in a collaborative and efficient manner. Furthermore, workshops may be expanded, covering topics such as SQL and the use of databases to reliably store and maintain data. Though of course it is impossible to train expert programmers in two days, Software Carpentry has had great success in teaching ‘just enough’ to researchers that they can then return to the lab with a strong foundation of skills to build from.

This presentation will focus on the major progress that has been made by Software Carpentry in Australia and worldwide since PyCon-Au 2014. In particular, the pool of Australian instructors has dramatically increased through the live training session held as part of the Research Bazaar conference held at Melbourne University in February. As such, the presentation will be somewhat meta – answering the question ‘What are the educational principles and techniques you should know before attempting to teach novice programmers?’ The Software Carpentry lesson content has also evolved in the last 12 months, with the lesson content expanding to such topics as the use of Pandas and the more effective use of the iPython Notebook to work with data and visualisation. These changes allow Software Carpentry to cater to a broader audience of researchers. There will also be some discussion of the Research Bazaar conference, which partnered with Software Carpentry this year to not only train instructors, but also run a series of other ‘basic skills’ workshops for researchers. Finally, there is an interesting sister organisation of Software Carpentry, known as Data Carpentry, which focuses on improving the way researchers work with and store their data.

We've all had those very detail-oriented clients who are able to specify their needs very neatly, often by means of exhaustive spreadsheets. Wouldn't it be nice if we could turn these spreadsheets straight into Python code?

In this tutorial we'll use two sets of meta-programming techniques to derive Python code out of semi-formal descriptions: first, to build Django models requiring very detailed validation supplied by the client in a spreadsheet; second, to build a Python API for a hardware device, the description of which is maintained by the engineers in a spreadsheet.

For the Pycon attendance, this tutorial has both business value and technical value:

Business value because spreadsheet-driven metaprogramming allows developers to:

- respond to changes very fast by re-rendering their Python code from the modified spreadsheet descriptions.
- avoid a certain class of human errors unavoidable when transcribing the requirements by hand.
- save time which can be employed in other areas of the project, or with other clients.
- clarify ambiguous specifications by making explicit all programmer's assumptions into the code generator.

Technical value because we'll be talking about:

- api design,
- Django modeling and validation,
- consuming spreadsheets via csv dictreaders and elbow grease,
- writing partially-applied functions via custom classes with a __call__ method,
- implementing fluent apis with table-driven __getattr__ methods,
- implementing iterators with __iter__ and __next__,
- papering over some differences between Python 2 and Python 3 syntax,
- and much, much more.

We'll be doing all of it in a hands-on manner, without getting distracted by abstract discussions of Python syntax. There will be some discussions of Python syntax, but they won't be abstract. We'll always have a goal in sight.

Level:

Intermediate. You'll learn some advanced techniques, but all you need to really know in order to follow this tutorial is how lists, dictionaries, iteration and reading files work in Python. 

Requirements:

- Attendees are expected to know basic Python (see above, under "Level").
- A laptop and some knowledge of git will be useful for those wanting to follow along, but is not required. You can get a lot out of this tutorial just by watching and paying attention.

What do sprinters eat before a race?
Nothing, they fast.

Sprinting at PyCon AU is not like that at all. Instead, it's a great chance to do something good for the community and get to know some fellow devs along the way. The sprints are an semi-formal two-day event following the close of the main track of the conference where people get together and code on whatever takes their fancy. Most of the time, it's a a chance to work on an open source package you're already involved with in some way, or to meet face-to-face with people you otherwise know only by email.

However, there are also those brave souls who are joining in for the first time. It can be particularly intimidating if you don't know the others there or how to really get started. This presentation will talk about the sprint format, how to get in with a sprint group, and how to be productive in such a short time (especially if you're new to the concept).

We'll cover off basics like getting your environment set up, checking out the code, and identifying appropriate projects and tasks to work on. Standard workflows and tips on how and when to approach people for assistance can also help to make things flow more smoothly.

It will also include some tips for sprint leaders about how to make your project easy and enjoyable for others to hack on. There is a lot than can be done without a lot of effort, such as pre-classifying bugs or identifying appropriate tasks for newcomers, identifying "go-to" people in your project, and spending time on the day talking to people and getting them comfortable working on your code. Clearly documenting simple workflows (like how to submit a patch, what code standards are used, and how to validate results) can help tremendously.

With any luck, this presentation can help both sprint leaders and attendees with a smoother experience which gets the difficulties out the way and leaves maximum opportunity for coding and enjoyment.

Tennessee has gone through the meatgrinder of sprinting, from sitting down with a group of strangers trying to help them fix trivial bugs, to developing significant extensions, to leading sprints. With the scars to show and lessons learned, he is in a reasonable position to help suggest some simple things that can make sprinting easier and more enjoyable for the newcomer.

A great strength of Django is how much functionality there is baked in without the developer doing anything to obtain it.

A corollary of this is that there’s a great deal of functionality in Django which the average developer is hardly aware exists. The happy dev is pleased to ignore the problems that have been solved for them as their requests rush in and their responses rush out.

There's Middleware, Signals, Authentication, Caching, Internationalization, Serialization and ... a lot more and that's just the core framework.

In this talk we’re going to stop and admire the view .

We’ll demonstrate the effects that these core aspects of Django have on a request - response cycle by reviewing how they work and feeling the pain of what life would be like without them.

My talk is aimed at the average Django dev who has been happy to ignore what goes on under the hood. By better understanding the machinery that Django relies on it gives us all the opportunity to exploit it in our work and, of course, to impress our colleagues!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Richard Shea</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4066/stop-and-smell-the-djangos</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl0wkY78jk4" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tl0wkY78jk4/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Swagger driven REST API development with the Falcon web server</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3953/swagger-driven-rest-api-development-with-the-falc</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

“it is impossible BY DEFINITION to do Test-Driven Development after the code is written.” — Tim Ottinger, author of ‘Clean Code’, on Twitter [1].

Automated testing is one of the most important tools in the modern programming toolbox: good tests help you find regressions early, and help you make sure your code is right before it ships. Test-driven development is a great way to make sure your software is up to specification before you start work. Even better, it makes sure your software’s architecture is amenable to writing tests from day 1.

So what happens when you find yourself working on code where automated testing took a back seat to being shipped? Chances are you’ll have a sea of bugs, strung together in a structure where writing simple unit tests just isn’t going to happen.

Broken code is a support burden, and if it’s in production, you’ve got no choice but to make things work. Luckily, automated testing isn’t a lost cause here!

In this talk, we’ll look at how to approach automated testing on late-stage, or even production code… or in any situation when you don’t have the luxury of starting with a test-driven structure. We’ll look at techniques that I’ve used to analyse faults in existing code, and how to translate those into tests, and how to use that to fix bugs.

In particular, we’ll look at:

- Tooling and metrics to help you decide what code to test, and how to measure progress when you’re writing tests
- Approaches to constructing test cases for old code, including using data-driven approaches, and approaches based on requirements specifications
- Granularity — making tests on old code granular enough is difficult, so we’ll look at the trade-offs between unit and integration tests on old code, and ways to make integration-level tests granular enough to make results reliable

We’ll see that testing old code is both achievable, and actually a worthwhile exercise. You’ll find bugs. You’ll increase quality. You’ll make your code more maintainable! Do try it!

...doesn't exist. (Sorry)

The power and flexibility of Django comes with drawbacks. One of the toughest for project management is working out how to deploy your Django application. If you ask five different authorities on how you should do it, you'll get six different answers.

And if someone says "Just use fabric!": they're not helping.

Release management, dependency wrangling, virtualenv care and feeding; to .whl or .deb? To containerize or Heroku-ize? Do you really have to allow your servers unconstrained Internet access just to build your virtualenv?

As a Django user, you might end up writing more deployment solutions than Django projects. I know I have.

There's no one true way of doing Django deployments, but some work better than others. Maybe I can show you.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tom Eastman</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4035/the-one-true-way-of-doing-django-deployments</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ABPQyANid0" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1ABPQyANid0/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Trials &amp; tribulations teaching Python at CoderDojo</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3980/trials-tribulations-teaching-python-at-coderdoj</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
This talk will relate the experience of teaching coding, including Python, to a (nominally) 6-18 age group at a local Brisbane CoderDojo for 2015 Term 1 and 2.

Scratch and Alice have become very popular for teaching beginner coding at CoderDojo events. Languages such as Python, and even HTML/CSS, are more difficult to introduce, partly because more skills are required before something "useful" can be created, and partly because the "building blocks" are usually not presented with the same visual immediacy as Scratch, and similar environments. This talk presents some of the difficulties found in transitioning from graphical environments to Python, and observations in using existing tools for learning Python with younger students.

Flask is a python web server and web framework that makes server-side programming using Python easy. Flask has less 'magic' than Django and therefore makes server requests and responses easier to understand for students. Python Anywhere is a cloud server that allows you to easily set up a live Flask or Django application. Students can develop and debug code online without the hassle of installing and configuring their development environments. This session will look at how Flask and Python Anywhere was used in the classroom with a year 12 student cohort.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brad Nielsen</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4064/using-flask-and-python-anywhere-in-the-classroom</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIh7G8RG6JM" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pIh7G8RG6JM/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>What Django can learn from Twisted</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4053/what-django-can-learn-from-twisted</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Web frameworks like Django are designed around the traditional request-response cycle — a request comes in, a response is generated, and that is delivered to the client. In the day of “single page” applications, where only sections of the page are updated through requests, doing real-time can be clunky. Twisted, and things that build off it, like Django Channels, might be worth thinking about, and this is what this talk will be about.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Amber "Hawkie" Brown</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4053/what-django-can-learn-from-twisted</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HZR7_ZBkYY" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_HZR7_ZBkYY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Writing Python For Kids</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3997/writing-python-for-kids</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Thinking of writing a book? We are in the midst of a boom in interest in amateur programming, particularly among children. Brendan spent the most recent summer past using his blog python4kids.brendanscott.com as inspiration for a new project based instructional book, Python for Kids for Dummies (US release by Wiley this northern summer). This talk will provide an overview of the development cycle for the book both in respect of the book's content and the process involved in creating that content and shepherding it through the publisher's internal processes. 
Topics to be covered include engaging and negotiating with the publisher, the different functions provided by a publisher, project management of the writing, interacting with editorial and technical reviewers, integrating with an existing "house style", art requirements and cross platform issues. In relation to content, Brendan will discuss the thought that went into targeting the material to a kids audience and the challenges involved in structuring a narrative which wends its way through each of the concepts that need to be introduced and providing a motivation for each of them. This includes how the content was structured, what concepts were included and what were passed over, trying to balance material to maintain interest without overwhelming the readers, the tension between explanation and demonstration and how to remain mindful of the audience's limitations. The highs, the lows, the triumphs (getting it done!) and tragedies (whole chapters consigned to the pyre), it's all here.

Doit is a Python library for task management and automation. It provides a straightforward Python approach to manage and execute any series of interrelated tasks, such as in scientific data analysis. Doit can be used as a command line substitute for Make to drive existing tools/applications, or can be integrated directly with your application at the Python level. Task automation can be as simple as manually specifying a dictionary of dependencies, target files and actions, or as complex as automatically determining dependencies and whether a task is up to date using arbitrary Python expressions. This talk will give an overview of why and how to use doit for your project.

This talk assumes no particular background except some familiarity with Python, but is geared towards a scientific computing audience and will touch on automated data analysis as a motivating example.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Sam Hames</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4055/automated-scientific-pipelines-with-doit</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccFqbCwcLko" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ccFqbCwcLko/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Keynote: Consequences of an Insightful Algorithm</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4047/keynote-consequences-of-an-insightful-algorithm</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
We have ethical responsibilities when coding. We’re able to extract remarkably precise intuitions about an individual. But do we have a right to know what they didn’t consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that leads us there? A major retailer’s data-driven marketing accidentally revealed to a teen’s family that she was pregnant. Eek.

What are our obligations to people who did not expect themselves to be so intimately known without sharing directly? How do we mitigate against unintended outcomes? For instance, an activity tracker carelessly revealed users’ sexual activity data to search engines. A social network’s algorithm accidentally triggered painful memories for grieving families who’d recently experienced death of their child and other loved ones.

We design software for humans. Balancing human needs and business specs can be tough. It’s crucial that we learn how to build in systematic empathy.

In this talk, we’ll delve into specific examples of uncritical programming, and painful results from using insightful data in ways that were benignly intended. You’ll learn ways we can integrate practices for examining how our code might harm individuals. We’ll look at how to flip the paradigm, netting consequences that can be better for everyone.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Carina C.

The problem of introducing children to programming and computer science has seen growing attention in the past few years. Initiatives like Raspberry Pi, Code Club, code.org, (and many more) have been created to help solve this problem. With the introduction of a national computing curriculum in the UK, teachers have been searching for a text based programming language to help teach computational thinking as a follow on from visual languages like Scratch.

The educational community has been served well by Python, benefiting from its straight-forward syntax, large selection of libraries, and supportive community. Education-focused summits are now a major part of most major Python Conferences. Assistance in terms of documentation and training is invaluable, but perhaps there are technical means of improving the experience of those using Python in education. Clearly the needs of teachers and their students are different to those of the seasoned programmer. Children are unlikely to come to their teachers with frustrations about the Global Interpreter Lock! But issues such as usability of IDEs or comprehensibility of error messages are of utmost importance.

In this keynote, Carrie Anne will discuss existing barriers to Python becoming the premier language of choice for teaching computer science, and how learning Python could be helped immensely through tooling and further support from the Python developer community.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Carrie Anne Philbin</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4059/keynote-designed-for-education-a-python-solutio</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaFk0Sya_HI" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gaFk0Sya_HI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Open edX: An edX partner perspective</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4039/open-edx-an-edx-partner-perspective</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Open edX is an open source MOOC platform. It powers courses on edx.org and those of the many adopters of the Open edX platform. Open edX is a complex platform with many interconnected parts, but the largest components are Python Django apps. 
This presentation will describe the experiences of developers at The University of Queensland's UQx project from 2013 when UQ joined the edX consortium through to the present and the future.

This project will demonstrate how to leverage CI/CD pipelines, to deploy and rollback applications in the Openstack Cloud. Best-practices allow to automate tasks and achieve high-degree of repeatability and robustness.

Jenkins will be used to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery jobs and pipelines. Packer will create images of disposable systems, being containers and Cloud servers.
Ansible will be used to both create images with Packer, and eventually orchestrate provisioning of systems in staging and production environments in a blue-green fashion.

Deep knowledge of deployment and workflow allows to continuously refine the process, adapt it to custom requirements, and make it smoother.

The following technologies will be presented:

- Ansible
- Docker on CoreOS cluster
- Git repository
- Jenkins
- Openstack
- Packer
- Vagrant</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Simone Soldateschi</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4048/orchestration-and-cicd-with-ansible-and-openstac</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFPtArm4Wc0" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QFPtArm4Wc0/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Tales from Managing an Open Source Python Game</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3974/tales-from-managing-an-open-source-python-game</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Ten years ago, a rag-tag bunch of computer camp leaders decided to create a game that would teach kids teamwork and strategy, and which the kids could feel a part of. In those days, the presenter was a young dreamer with time on his hands, and he chose to spearhead the project. Was this folly? You be the judge. The game was Trosnoth. It is developed in Python, using Pygame and Twisted.
In this presentation, Josh will tell the story of Trosnoth, and share some of the many lessons, both social and technical, which he learnt while managing the project. Maybe you’ve considered writing a game in Python. Maybe you’re not sure how Open Source projects really work. Maybe you’re an experienced project manager who wants to laugh at some of the mistakes Josh made. Or maybe you just enjoy hearing Josh tell stories. Whoever you are, there’s bound to be something in this presentation for you.

In practically every moment of our life we rely on the possibly largest communication medium humanity ever had. The Internet. Being able to at least partially understand how this *thing* works, we know that it takes a lot of work to keep it running smoothly.
                                                                              
To do that IT administrators use configuration and system management tools to deploy changes to thousands of servers and keep them in sync. But how can one roll back a change done in the past that turned out to introduce a bug?

During the development of a Python web application the inbuilt development web server provided by the web framework is often what is used. When moving to a production environment, one has to choose a more capable production grade WSGI deployment mechanism. Which of the various WSGI servers available is going to be the most suitable is going to depend on a range of criteria related to your specific web applications requirements.

Unfortunately, rather than look at the bigger picture and what would be the most suitable across such criteria, many people will simply rush to trying to run an overly simplistic benchmark on the various WSGI servers and make the decision based purely on perceptions of whether one WSGI server is faster than the alternatives. Worse, they don't even attempt to do the benchmarks themselves and instead rely on benchmarks published on some public blog site.

Such public benchmarks as are available are often flawed, or cover such a narrow use case as to in no way be relevant to that users own specific situation.

A further problem with such benchmarks is that they try and evaluate the performance of a WSGI server as if they are a black box. As such, there is no attempt to try and work out what is actually going on within the WSGI server and why it is exhibiting the behaviour it is.

The purpose of this talk is to explore a number of different micro benchmarks, using them to work out what is actually going on within a WSGI server when they are run. The analysis will delve down into, and look at the different ways that WSGI servers are implemented and deployed. The behaviour under the different benchmarks will be determined using fine grained metrics captured from hooking instrumentation into the WSGI servers themselves.

As there are many factors which could be investigated, the talk cannot be entirely comprehensive, but selected benchmarks drawing from a sub set of the following areas will be presented:

* multithreading
* CPU intensive tasks
* long running requests
* combination of short and long running requests
* large request content uploads
* large amounts of response content
* blocking on back end services
* slow HTTP clients

The tests will look not just at response times, but also server capacity utilisation, CPU and memory utilisation.

Although the discussion will primarily revolve around WSGI servers, a comparison will also be made for some tests were one instead to use an ASYNC web application framework alone, or in conjunction with a WSGI adapter.

To conclude, an attempt will be made to summarise what you should be looking at in a WSGI server to determine if it is the right choice for your use case.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Graham Dumpleton</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4049/using-benchmarks-to-understand-how-wsgi-servers-w</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGleKfigMsk" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SGleKfigMsk/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Using PyCharm Educational Edition</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4062/using-pycharm-educational-edition</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

This talk highlights my experiences using PyCharm Lessons to teach beginners Python. 
As a fairly new piece of software, there are a number of bugs that can cause a lot of pain when first starting out. This talk will demonstrate the steps to creating lessons and tests, publishing them and sharing them with students, while avoiding problems with the system.
