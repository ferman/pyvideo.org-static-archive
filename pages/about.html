      This is a video index of Python-related video on the Internet.
      It does not <em>host</em> video&mdash;it's an index.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each video is lovingly packaged with a variety of metadata that
      comprises the context of the video: When was it taken? What was
      the venue? Who was speaking? What was the topic of the talk?
      What are the related links? Are there quality issues with the
      video?
    </p>
    <p>
      It's our hope that this metadata brings the video that's
      currently scattered about easier to find and easier to use.
    </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Want to add a new conference?</h3>
      <p>
        Toss an issue in <a href="https://github.com/pyvideo/pyvideo/issues">the
        issue tracker</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm working on making it easier for other people to add new
        conferences to the site so that I'm not the bottleneck, but
        that work hasn't landed, yet.

        If you want to contribute to this site, you'll have to wait
        a bit until we get a contributor infrastructure going. I
        really want to make it easy for people to help make the
        metadata better, but the code isn't there, yet.

        In the meantime, if you have questions, comments or concerns
        about this site, want to help out with richard development,

      <h3>Is this site helpful to you? Do you want to tip us for the work
        we're doing?</h3>
      <p>
        We work on pyvideo in our free time. That covers development
        of richard (the software that powers pyvideo and other video
        indexing sites), maintaining infrastructure, fixing issues
        with the data and adding new conferences. It may not look like
        much, but it's a lot of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had Gratipay links, but rarely (if at all) got anyone
        tipping, so we removed them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If pyvideo is important to you and you want to encourage more
        development/work on it, you should show you care. Send Will an email
        at willkg at bluesock dot org.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>How is this site put together?</h3>
      <p>
        The software that runs this site is called richard. It's a free
        software project. You can find the code on GitHub at
        <a href="http://github.com/pyvideo/richard">http://github.com/pyvideo/richard</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The software that we use to work on the metadata and add it to
        pyvideo.org is called steve. It's also a free software project.
        You can find the code on GitHub at
        <a href="http://github.com/pyvideo/steve">http://github.com/pyvideo/steve</a>.
        Steve is very much an "in-progress" project and gets adjusted
        as our needs dictate.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3>Future plans</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Done!: Better feed support
        <li>Done!: Read-only API
        <li>Better subtitling support whether that's through Universal
          Subtitles or something else
        <li>Better metadata
        <li>Better browsing interface
        <li>Better search interface
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most of these are being worked on in the underlying
        software. See <a href="https://github.com/pyvideo/richard/issues">richard
        issue tracker</a> for details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the data in pyvideo.org is ok, but could be a lot
        better. We're working on improving that, making it easier for
        other people to improve it, and adding additional conferences to
        the index.
      </p>
