[EuroPython 2012] N Larosa - 4 JULY 2012 in "Track Ravioli"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Take care of the most important thing, your psychophysical well-being, and be
efficient about it. You don’t need to be hungry (well, just a little bit), do
lots of exercise (well, just a little bit) and spend a lot of time and money
(well, just a little bit… uhm, there seems to be a pattern :-) ). You just
need to take care of your body using the same thing that lets you program
computers: your mind. No, the human body is not “a machine”, as it’s often
said: it’s much more complex than that. Nonetheless, knowledge of a few facts,
some guiding principles, and some tech tools (we’re geeks after all, aren’t
we? :-) ) can definitely improve your life. Warning: this speaker is not a
doctor, and this talk is not medical advice. Get the advice of a qualified
doctor/physician before changing your diet and/or your physical regimen.
Neither this speaker nor the conference organization will be liable for any
injuries or illnesses you may incur by however applying the concepts discussed
in this talk.
