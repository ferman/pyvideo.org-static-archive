Creating a robot or an intelligent agent which can behave as a human being, make decisions effectively, take actions optimally, and more over, can learn from its own experience were always be a goal for scientists. This presentation describes how everybody can create a software agent capable to learn from its own actions and adopt its behavior by using reinforcement learning approach. A few examples of self-learning agents will be shown and discussed during presentation.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ian Tsybulkin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2014 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3357/how-to-create-a-self-learning-robot</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8cgxDaTapg" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r8cgxDaTapg/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
