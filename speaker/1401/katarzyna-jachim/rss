When you think about Python+testing, you usually think about testing your code - unittests, mostly. But it is not the only case! When you have a big system, you need to test it on much higher level - if only to check if all the components are wired in the right way. You may do it manually, but it is tedious and time-consuming - so you want to automate it. And here comes Python - the language of choice in many QA departments.

I will tell about differences between unittesting and system testing which result in totally different requirements on test management/running systems. I will tell how we use Python (and a little why) to automate our work. Finally, I will tell a little about my "idee fixe" - a framework for system testing written in Python.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Katarzyna Jachim</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2984/python-in-system-testing</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-Hbi81G6Ls" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/I-Hbi81G6Ls/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
