[EuroPython 2011] Mark Ramm-Christensen - 23 June 2011 in "Track Lasagne"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Two years ago I started working on SourceForge with a couple of python
developers. Back then the site was written in PHP and was in some ways buried
in technical debt. Everything is different today, we have a complete set of
tools for Ticket tracking, Wiki documents, Git, Mercurial, Subversion, and IRC
- all written in Python, and now released as open source software.

This is the story of how the amazing libraries, tools, and talent in the
Python web community has radically changed an established company, and allowed
us to reinvent sourceforge.net.

This talk will go over our tech stack, talk about the libraries we used, the
way we solved scalability, internationalization, and performance issues
issues. Ultimately we know that without python, we could not have built a
flexible plugin based system, and gotten permission from management to open
source it.

&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
To Relate or Not to Relate, that is the question raised by the NoSQL movement.
There is a lot of buzz about Couch, Casandra, MongoDB, and other non
relational databases, and at the same time there are decades of hard work
that's gone into optimizing databases built around the relational model.

I would actually argue that there is no such thing as a NoSQL database - there
are a variety of compelling options to relational database - each of which
have different features and different performance characteristics. So no one-
sized fits all comparison will do. So, I'll try to outline a general taxonomy
for persistence mechanisms, and then proceed to comparing relational DB's to
their new friends in practice.

The talk will contain quite a few stories from the trenches with CouchDB,
MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Tokyo Cabinet, ZODB, and other databases, and will
help you think about the data storage needs of your applications in new ways.
