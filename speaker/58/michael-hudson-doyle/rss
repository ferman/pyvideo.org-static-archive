An introduction to PyPy

Presented by Michael Hudson-Doyle

Abstract

An overview of the ideas behind the project, its current status, future plans
and why you should care about it.

Outline

The core idea of PyPy is to produce a flexible and fast implementation of the
Python programming language. The talk will cover the interpreter, translator
and jit parts of the code and their relationships and the fundamental ways in
which PyPy differs from other virtual machine implementations.

How we use Twisted in Launchpad

Presented by Michael Hudson-Doyle

Abstract

Launchpad is a large, open source, "real world" Python project with many
moving parts. This talk will explain how Twisted helps us keep track of them.

Outline

Although we don't use it for the core web application, most other places in
Launchpad that have to deal with concurrency issues do it using Twisted. This
talk will survey these areas and talk about issues we've found and design
patterns we've found helpful.
