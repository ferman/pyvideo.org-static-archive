[EuroPython 2011] Deepak Thukral - 22 June 2011 in "Track Ravioli "


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The primary goal of this talk is twofold: to evaluate the need of data mining
and introduce some very cool, simple yet powerful machine learning techniques
to audience such as classification, clustering, collaborative filtering,
recommendation etc in your Python web applications. This talk will conclude
with some explanation and limitations of machine learning algorithms.

Basic knowledge of Python is sufficient. However some experience with Django,
meshups, machine learning or data hunger is encouraged. All talk material and
django apps will be available after talk under MIT license.
