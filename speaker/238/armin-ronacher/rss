[EuroPython 2012] A Ronacher - 5 JULY 2012 in "Track Pizza Margherita"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
This talk shows some interesting patterns for large scale Flask applications
and how Flask extension should be structured. It also dives into some of the
more unknown helpers in the Werkzeug and Jinja2 base libraries. The goal of
this talk is to share some of the things that the documentation canâ€™t explain
well by itself. Required prerequisites: basic knowledge of how Flask operates.

For many DSLs such as templating languages it's important to use code
generation to achieve acceptable performance in Python. The current version of
Jinja went through many different iterations to end up where it is currently.
This talk walks through the design of Jinja2's compiler infrastructure and why
it works the way it works and how one can use newer Python features for better
results.

[EuroPython 2011] Armin Ronacher - 20 June 2011 in "Track Spaghetti"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
What was my motivation for working with Python after two years of PHP? There
is so much you can do. Functions are objects you can pass around, you can
decompile functions to see how they work internally, you can alias a bound
method to a global function and it will just work. You can change import
semantics, override the method resolution order, you can write metaclasses,
you can hook into the CPython interpreter API and much more.

Five years later I came to the conclusion that this is really not what Python
is about and that a lot of what I did was interesting but not necessarily a
good idea. This talk is a 45 minute recompilation of things I really shouldn't
have done in the first place. Expect a bunch of neat and interesting hacks
that showcase the possibilities of the language.

Opening the Flask

Presented by Armin Ronacher

After a year of the Flask microframework it's time to draw some conclusions,
see things that went right and things that should be improved. The talk gives
both an introduction into Flask itself as well as well as the ecosystem that
evolved around it.

Abstract

Flask is a microframework that was born out of an April's fool joke that
quickly became more than that. Based on the powerful foundation of Werkzeug
and Jinja2 it's one of the most popular frameworks for Python now.

The talk starts with a very quick introduction into Flask, where it all
started and why I think people like it. We will look into the design of Flask
and why it works the way it works.

Furthermore we will look into the Flask ecosystem and how extensions work and
have a brief look in what is planned for the future, especially regarding
Python 3.

The talk assumes basic knowledge of web applications.
