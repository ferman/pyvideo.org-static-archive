[EuroPython 2011] Gisle Aas - 21 June 2011 in "Track Lasagne"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Abstract: Whether you’re an independent developer or development manager in a
large company, “the cloud” is on everyone’s mind. But just because it’s in the
cloud, doesn’t mean development and deployment is effortless. The cloud
presents infrastructure and development challenges in a new way.

In this presentation, ActiveState's Gisle Aas will share best practices in
building and deploying a Python-centric LAMP stack(s) on the cloud for a range
of web-based applications from simple Django site to HPC GPU Clusters.

Based on ActiveState’s experiences, Gisle will discuss the challenges faced
and lessons learned in building an infrastructure to deploy web applications
to the cloud with Python.

You will learn about:

  * Which packages are critical for a secure, Python-centric LAMP stack (and what it takes to build them)! 
  * Tips for developing, deploying, and scaling Python applicaitons in the cloud 
  * How to use Python to connect and build infrastructure to support and manage your deployment
