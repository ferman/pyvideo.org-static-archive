[EuroPython 2012] F Buynooghe - 5 JULY 2012 in "Track Ravioli"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Sockets are a fundamental abstraction operating systems provide to expose
networking operations. Initially they look like a fairly straight forward
interface but they hide a surprising amount of complexity. Many protocol
libraries hide sockets away from the developer but it can still be useful to
know the sockets themselves. Other times directly using sockets is just a
better or simpler option. This talk will cover practical socket programming in
python, concentrating on TCP and UDP over IP (v4 &amp; v6) the basic APIs of
address resolution and using sockets will be covered. Common patterns and
pitfalls will be pointed out which should enable to you to write robust socket
code with the help of tools like StringIO and memoryview. After the basics
pythonâ€™s higher level abstractions like create_connection(), .makefile() and
the io module are covered, explaining when and how these can make life easier.
Finally a quick look at how non-blocking sockets can be used and how libraries
like asyncore/asynchat, twisted, eventlet and gevent all approach non-blocking
I/O in their own way.
