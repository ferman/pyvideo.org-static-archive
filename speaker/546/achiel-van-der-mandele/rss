[EuroPython 2011] Achiel van der Mandele - 24 June 2011 in "Track Lasagne"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
XMPP is an open technology for real-time communication. Although primarily
known for its application in the IM service "Jabber" (and, subsequently,
gchat/gtalk), it has numerous applications and creates new opportunities for
inter-system communication.

While researching for an alternative to webservices at Mendix, we came across
XMPP and realized it solved many of the shortcomings of webservices. It is
currently being used to handle all inter-system and inter-process
communication in the Mendix cloud hosting environment.

The talk will give a general overview of what XMPP is, an introduction to the
sleekxmpp python library and how the core features of xmpp can help an
architecture scale well horizontally.

Required knowledge: basic understanding of hosting environments.
