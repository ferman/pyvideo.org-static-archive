The pandas and scikit-learn packages combine together to produce a powerful toolkit for data analytics. In this talk, we will be using them together to analyse the outcome of NBA games, trying to predict the winner of a match. There is plenty of data out there to allow us to create good predictions â€“ the key is getting it in the right format and building the right model.

In this talk we will go through importing data from the net, cleaning it up, creating new features, and building a predictive model. We then evaluate how well we did, using recent NBA data. The model we use will be a decision tree ensemble called a random forest.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Robert Layton</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/4061/predicting-sports-winners-using-data-analytics-wi</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7hSD_-gWMw" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k7hSD_-gWMw/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>scikit-learn, machine learning and cybercrime attribution</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2228/scikit-learn-machine-learning-and-cybercrime-att</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
The scikit-learn library is a rapidly growing open source toolkit for machine learning in python. It allows for practitioners and researchers to apply machine learning in a variety of applications and is used by companies worldwide. Developed by programmers from around the world, the project has a large (and increasing) number of machine learning algorithms, a very useful set of utility functions and has also spawned a set of detailed tutorials. Written in python with the aid of numpy, scipy and cython, this library is featured, fast and extensible.

In this talk, I will introduce scikit-learn, giving an overview of the library, its features and how to use it for a number of different applications. Next talk about some of the tutorials that are actively being developed for learning machine learning and scikit-learn and also how to contribute. Through this, I'll introduce some key machine learning concepts and how you can apply them to a variety of tasks. The focus will be on practical uses, rather than theoretical advances.

To end the presentation, I'll briefly overview the research I perform at the Internet Commerce Security Laboratory (University of Ballarat) in cybercrime attribution, where I work with our industry partners to disrupt cybercrime. While it can be very difficult to do direct network based attribution, indirect methods through criminal profiling may assist in stopping crimes such as phishing or online fraud. I'll walk through some of our results in identifying the size and scope of the operations behind some of these attacks.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Robert Layton</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2228/scikit-learn-machine-learning-and-cybercrime-att</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/scikitlearn_machine_learning_a.mp4" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/scikitlearn_machine_learning_a.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onYs20ykbBY" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/onYs20ykbBY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
