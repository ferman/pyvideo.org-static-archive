Fliptop's primary business used to be contact record linkage. We built-out some substantial infrastructure, coding primarily in Scala, and using JVM-stack libraries. In the past year, we've moved beyond our data business into building predictive analytics applications for Sales and Marketing teams, so it was necessary to build a data science/machine learning stack. While there's plenty of machine-learning tools for the JVM, we felt that the Python ecosystem had many advantages for our use-case (which we'll discuss), and we think we integrated them in a clever way.


About the speaker


I'm a data scientist and software engineer. Languages of choice are Scala and Python. I have been working with AWS for production for over three years. My interest is in building data analytics applications with cloud computing technologies.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Jerry Chou</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jun 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3271/how-to-integrate-python-into-a-scala-stack-to-bui</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFoPCxpQaxc" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eFoPCxpQaxc/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
