Hy (https://github.com/hylang/hy) is an implementation of a Lisp language on top of Python. It The project has been started this year, and is making good progress, since a lot of code can already be executed. Compatibility with Python is one of its core attribute, and in this regard it follows the path that Clojure took with Java.

This talk will present you what Hy is, how it works internally (briefly), what you can accomplish with it, how to contribute, and obviously how to write code with it!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Julien Danjou</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 30 Nov 2013 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3747/hy-a-lisp-on-python</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ah9fwabLD70" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ah9fwabLD70/maxresdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
