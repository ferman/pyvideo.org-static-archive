Applying functional programming ideas to solve the problem of packaging software and configuration of systems in a stateless and deterministic way. Nix project addresses those problems in unique way based on academic research that has been applied to real world software collections in last 10 years.

In Python, we're trying to solve packaging problems in our own domain, but maybe someone else already solved most our problems. 

In the talk I'll show how I develop and deploy Python projects that can be easily mixed with non-Python dependencies. 

http://nixos.org/nix/ will be demonstrated to replace technologies in our stack: pip, virtualenv, buildout, ansible, jenkins.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Domen Ko탑ar</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2014 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3346/rethinking-packaging-development-and-deployment-0</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MODZCTk8iK0" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MODZCTk8iK0/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Rethinking packaging, development and deployment</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3036/rethinking-packaging-development-and-deployment</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Python is often mixed with other languages in development stack, nowadays it's hard to escape any JavaScript dependencies. If you add some C dependencies such as GStreamer to the stack, packaging becomes a burden.

While tweaking our packaging infrastructure will make things better, it's hard to fix fundamental problem of packaging with current ad-hoc solutions in Python domain.

Using Nix (http://nixos.org/nix/) for about a year gave me an insight that solving packaging problem at operating system level (bottom-up) is a better approach.

For example, wouldn't it be cool to have "virtualenv" implemented inside your package manager, so you could isolate also non-Python dependencies and not just Python packages for your project and not worry if system was updated?

We'll also show what benefits do we get by using the same tool for development and deployment and how little we have to do to deploy our application.

To see how Haskell community is touching the same subject, see blog post http://ocharles.org.uk/blog/posts/2014-02-04-how-i-develop-with-nixos.html
