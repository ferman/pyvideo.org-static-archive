Python 3: the next generation is here already

Presented by wesley chun

This talk is about the evolution of Python. We will discuss Python 2 and
Python 3: what the compatibility issues are, what the main differences are,
and also talk about migration, Python 2.6/2.7, and other transition tools.

Abstract

Python is currently at a crossroads: Python 2 has taken it from a quiet word-
of-mouth language to primetime, with many companies around the world using it
and an ever-increasing global marketshare of the programming world. But now
comes Python 3, the first version of the language that is not backwards
compatible with previous releases.

What does this mean? Are all my Python programs going to break? Will I have to
rewrite everything? How much time do I have? When is Python 2 going to be
EOL'd? Is the language undergoing a complete rewrite and will I even recognize
it? What are the changes between Python 2 and 3 anyway? Also, the next
generation is already here, as Python 3 is over two years old now. What has
been ported so far, and what is its current status? Are migration plans or
transition tools available? If I want to start learning Python, should I do
Python 2 or Python 3? Are all Python 2 books obsolete?

We will attempt to answer all of these questions and more. Join us!

Running Django Apps on Google App Engine

Presented by wesley chun

In the past, Django users couldn't run apps unmodified on Google App Engine.
Some tools helped with integration but required you to change your data
models. Django-nonrel removes this requirement letting you run native Django
apps on App Engine with only config changes if you bear in mind its
restrictions like no JOINs. In this talk, we'll discuss Django-nonrel &amp;
porting App Engine apps to Django.

Abstract

Previously, Django users could not get their apps to run unmodified on Google
App Engine, the cloud application-hosting platform. Older tools like "the
Helper" and "the Patch" required a change to the data models as well as
perhaps integrating additional tools into the application source tree. The
creators of the Patch realized how cumbersome this is and created a
replacement for all of these older tools.

Django-nonrel allows users to run pure Django apps on App Engine with only
minor configuration changes. It basically enables Django's ORM to operate on
top of non-relational databases (in addition to preserving its ability to
support standard relational DBs), one of which is Google App Engine's
Datastore. (MongoDB is another.)

What this means that current Django users can now use their existing knowledge
to write apps for App Engine as long as they keep App Engine restrictions in
mind, e.g., no JOINs. Projects written in this manner will work without any
modifications other than changing the configuration settings. On the other
side, App Engine developers now have an alternative to the '"webapp" framework
that comes with its SDK. You can now leverage the power of a full web
framework like Django and still enjoy the flexibility and scalability of App
Engine. In this talk, we'll discuss Django-nonrel, and how to port App Engine
apps from webapp to pure Django to run on App Engine using Django-nonrel.

Writing Books using Python and Open Source Software

  
Presented by Mr. wesley j. chun

  
These days, there are countless number of software applications and web
services that have been developed using free and open source software (FOSS).
Such tools have become so flexible, powerful, and universal, that it should
also be possible for authors to write manuscripts using open source tools like
Python in the same way that applications are developed. In this talk, we
present some case studies of this phenomenon.
