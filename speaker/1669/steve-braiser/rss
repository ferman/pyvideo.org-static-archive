This talk will discuss the design and implementation of a Python-based tool-set to aid in assessing the response of the UK's Advanced Gas Reactor nuclear power stations to earthquakes. The seismic analyses themselves are carried out with a commercial Finite Element solver, but understanding the raw data this produces requires customised post-processing and visualisation tools. Extending the existing tools had become increasingly difficult and a decision was made to develop a new, Python-based tool-set. This comprises of a post-processing framework ("aftershock") which includes an an embedded Python interpreter, and a plotting package ("afterplot") based on numpy and matplotlib.

The new tool-set had to be significantly more flexible and easier to maintain than the existing code-base, while allowing the majority of development to be carried out by engineers with little training in software development. The resulting architecture will be described with a focus on exploring how the design drivers were met and the successes and challenges arising from the choices made.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Steve Braiser</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3326/a-python-based-post-processing-toolset-for-seismi</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiqPbiWv2hY" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BiqPbiWv2hY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
