Ansible is a powerful DevOps swiss-army knife tool, very easy to configure and with many extensions built-in. This talk will quickly introduce the basics of Ansible, then some real-life experience tips on how to use this tool, from setting up dev VMs to multi-server setups.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Infrastructure/Scaling is a topic really close to me, I'd like to have the chance to talk about how we set this up in the company I work for. Our infrastructure is around 10-15 servers,  provisioned on different cloud providers, so a good size infrastructure.

Presentation is going to be divided in 3 parts, first part is going to be focused on comparing sysadmin and devops, then there will be an introduction to the basic concepts of Ansible. I want to spend most on the last part, which is going to give some tips based on our experience with it.

Many ideas will come from this presentation https://speakerdeck.com/fmarani/devops-with-ansible which i gave at DJUGL in London, with a longer session I will have more chances to delve into more detail, especially on how we use it, from vagrant boxes setup to AWS and DigitalOcean boxes, network configuration, software configurations, etc... 

I want to offer as many real-life tips as possible, without going too much offtopic as far as Ansible is concerned</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Federico Marani</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3004/scaling-with-ansible</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptc9E24YAcc" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ptc9E24YAcc/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
