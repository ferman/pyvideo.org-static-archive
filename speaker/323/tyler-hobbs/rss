Apache Cassandra is an open source, distributed (NoSQL) database. This will
give a high level introduction to Cassandra and its data model; it will detail
the features of pycassa, the Python client library for Cassandra, and how to
interact with Cassandra through it.


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Being non-relational, Cassandra's data model is fundamentally different from
that of a relational database. In addition, it uses an RPC based API rather
than a query language. On top of that, Cassandra is a distributed database, so
the client must be aware of and interact with multiple nodes in the cluster.
All of these attributes of Cassandra make the client libraries a different
experience. Fortunately, the Python client library is the easiest way to use
Cassandra. This talk will start with a high level overview of the clustering
model of Cassandra then its data model. A large portion of the talk will cover
the pycassa methods that interact with the data model of Cassandra, i.e.
inserting, fetching, and removing data. A small amount of time will be
dedicated to describing connection pooling in pycassa -- how it handles node
failures, distributes requests, etc. The final 10 minutes will be devoted to
Q&amp;A.
