&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
We discuss recent advances in the Object Oriented Finite-Element project at
NIST (also called [OOF](http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof/oof2)), a Python and C++
tool designed to bring sophisticated numerical modeling capabilities to users
in the field of Materials Science.

As part of the effort to expand the solid-mechanics capabilities of the code,
the solver has been extended to include the ability to handle history-dependent
properties, such as occur in viscoplastic systems, and inequality constraints,
which are present in conventional isotropic plasticity, as well as surface
interactions.

This software provides numerous tools for constructing finite-element meshes from microstructural images, and for implementing material properties from a very broad class which includes elasticity, chemical and thermal diffusion, and electrostatics.

The code is a hybrid of Python and C++ code, with the high level user interface and control code in Python, and the heavy numeric work being done in C++. Numerous tools are provided for constructing finite-element meshes from microstructural images, and for implementing material properties from a very broad class which includes elasticity, chemical and thermal diffusion, and electrostatics. The software can be operated either as an interactive, GUI-driven application, as a scripted command-line tool, or as a supporting library, providing useful access to users of varying levels of expertise. At every level, the user-interface objects are intended to be familiar to the materials-science user.

The modular object-oriented design of the code, and the strategy of separating the finite-element infrastructure from the material constitutive rules proved itself in implementing the new solid-mechanics capabilities.

Development on a fully-3D version of the code has also made significant progress, overcoming several challenges associated with user-interface issues. A nontrivial, solved 3D problem will be presented.

The Object Oriented Finite-Element project at NIST
&lt;[http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof](http://www.ctcms.nist.gov/oof)&gt; is a Python
and C++ tool designed to bring sophisticated numerical modeling capabilities
to users in the field of Materials Science. The software provides numerous
tools for constructing finite-element meshes from microstructural images, and
for implementing material properties from a very broad class which includes
elasticity, chemical and thermal diffusion, and electrostatics. The current
series of releases has a robust interface for defining new nonlinear
properties, and provides both first and second order time-dependence in the
equations of motion. The development team is currently working on a fully-3D
version of the code, as well as expanding the scope of available properties to
include surface interactions, such as surface tension and chemical reactions,
and inequality constraints, such as arise in mechanical surface contact and
plasticity. The software is a hybrid of Python and C++ code, with the high
level user interface and control code in Python, and the heavy numeric work
being done in C++. The software can be operated either as an interactive, GUI-
driven application, as a scripted command-line tool, or as a supporting
library, providing useful access to users of varying levels of expertise. At
every level, the user-interface objects are intended to be familiar to the
materials-science user. This presentation will focus on an interesting example
of a nonlinear property, called Ramberg-Osgood elasticity, and the process for
incorporating this feature into the OOF architecture.
