Software engineering researchers and hackers don't talk to each other as much as they ought to. This talk aims to bridge that gap, teach practitioners about what research is out there, and spark a "citizen science" movement in software engineering. I'll explain how to study your own projects and get academics to pay attention. Together, we can learn how to develop better software.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tavish Armstrong</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2696/software-engineering-research-for-hackers-bridgi</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvEY6bhLXsU" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/vvEY6bhLXsU/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
