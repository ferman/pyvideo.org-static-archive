Digital holographic microscopy is a fast 3D imaging technique.  A camera records a time series of light scattering patterns as standard 2D images and then post-processing routines extract 3D information.  By creating a GPU-accelerated GUI on top of the Holopy package, we noticed unexpected discrepancies between the different models used during post-processing.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Digital holographic microscopy is a fast 3D imaging technique ideally suited to
studies of micron-sized objects that diffuse through random walks via Brownian
motion [[1]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/OE.15.018275).  Microspheres fit this
category and are widely used in biological assays and as ideal test subjects
for experiments in statistical mechanics.  Microspheres suspended in water move
too quickly to monitor with confocal microscopy.  With digital holographic
microscopy, 2D images encoding 3D volumes can be recorded at thousands of
frames per second
[[2]](http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v11/n2/abs/nmat3190.html).  The
computationally challenging part of digital holographic microscopy is
extracting the 3D information during post-processing.

The open source
[Holopy](https://launchpad.net/holopy) package which relies heavily on SciPy
and NumPy is used to recover the 3D information via one of two techniques:
reconstruction by numerical back-propagation of electromagnetic fields or
modeling forward light scattering with Mie theory.  The parameter space
describing the imaged volume is multidimensional.  Even for simple micron-sized
spheres, a hologram depends on each sphere's radius and index of refraction in
addition to its 3D position.  By supplementing Holopy with a [GPU-accelerated
GUI](https://github.com/RebeccaWPerry/holography-gpu) using PyQt4, we enabled
users to interactively adjust the system parameters and see a modeled digital
hologram change in response.

Simply adding the capability of
interactively manipulating holograms in a GUI led us to notice unexpected
discrepancies between the two modeling techniques and failures of both,
suggesting further experiments.  We observed that the numerical light
propagation technique only accurately characterizes the light within a cone
stretching from the extent of the image back towards the object.  Neither model
accurately characterizes the light upstream of the object toward the light
source.  The GUI was a natural format to interact with the theory and gain
insight because it showed us the models in an analogous format to how we see
the data on the microscope.  Other scientific projects may benefit from tools
that allow experimentalists to interact with theory in the same way they
interact with their experiments.
