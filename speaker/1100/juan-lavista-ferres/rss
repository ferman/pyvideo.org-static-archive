Controlled experiments, also called randomized experiments and A/B tests, have had a profound influence on multiple fields, including medicine, agriculture, manufacturing, and advertising. In software development, multiple techniques are used to define product requirements; controlled experiments provide a valuable way to assess the impact of new features on customer behavior.

Having run hundreds of experiments on more than 20 websites, including some of the world’s largest, like msn.com and bing.com, we have learned some important practical lessons. These lessons, even for seemingly simple univariate experiments, aren’t taught in Statistics 101.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Juan Lavista Ferres</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2306/the-importance-of-experimentation</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKLo_mD152Y" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/rKLo_mD152Y/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
