Machine learning deals with a class of algorithms which improve and evolve as
they process more data. It has wide-ranging applications in recommendations,
search, spam/fraud detection, facial recognition and other areas. The
algorithms themselves will be covered but the real focus of this class is on
how to use said algorithms in the web applications we work on every day.
I&amp;aposll try to keep the math and notation relatively light. Most of the
algorithms you&amp;aposll need to get started with machine learning are
implemented for you in the various libraries. They comprise the "science" of
machine learning and I hope you will decide to learn it, but mastering that
material is a significant commitment of your time and mental energy (and has
some additional prerequisites including a strong understanding of linear
algebra). This class will focus on the "art" of machine learning, how to think
about machine learning algorithms and integrate them into your web
application.

MapReduce has become one of two dominant paradigms in distributed computing
(along with MPI). Yet many times, implementing an algorithm as a MapReduce job
- especially in Python - forces us to sacrifice efficiency (BLAS routines,
etc.) in favor of data parallelism.

In my work, which involves writing distributed learning algorithms for
processing terabytes of Twitter data at SocialFlow, I've come to advocate a
form of "vectorized MapReduce" which integrates efficient numerical libraries
like numpy/scipy into the MapReduce setting, yielding both faster per-machine
performance and reduced I/O, which is often a major bottleneck. I'll also
highlight some features of Disco (a Python/Erlang MapReduce implementation
from Nokia) which make it a very compelling choice for writing scientific
MapReduce jobs in Python.
