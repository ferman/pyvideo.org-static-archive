The Django community is full of amazing, enthusiastic and multi-talented individuals who love to take on exciting new extra-curricular projects in their massive amounts of spare time. 

A Django podcast is an excellent example of this kind of project and it is one that has been taken up no less than 5 times so far.

I am the latest to take up this torch.

This has so far been an amazing, educational, exhilarating experience: I have had the honour of gathering the thoughts of some of the best, brightest and most prolific in our community. It's been a load of work but also a load of fun.

Come hear the story of how this has happened, and come to learn how you can be part of the greater Django information and communication machinery.

PyCon Australia is the national conference for users of the Python Programming Language. In August 2014, we're heading to Brisbane to bring together students, enthusiasts, and professionals with a love of Python from around Australia, and all around the World.

Curious about being involved in open source, but haven't had the time to make the plunge?
 Involved with open source but a bit hazy on the way it all works?
 Open source legend Andrew Tridgell runs an annual week-long post-graduate primer course teaching ""Free and Open Source Software Development "". This talk will convey as much of this course as possible in the time available.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Elena Williams</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2646/hitchhikers-guide-to-participating-in-open-source</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kV0b0KhaMQ" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8kV0b0KhaMQ/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
