[EuroPython 2011] Matteo Boscolo - 22 June 2011 in "Track Tagliatelle "


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
PythonCAD is a CAD package written, surprisingly enough, in Python using the
PyQt interface. The PythonCAD project aims to produce a scriptable, open-
source, easy to use CAD package for Linux (Cross Platforms).

I start developing PythonCAD in my spare time and now python is the
programming language that I mostly use. I think that will be very interesting
to tell my story and how I learn python pyqt ,sqlite, sympy… and how python
and pycon and OpenERP change my job.

The goal will be to tell at the new python programmer how easy to use is
python even for complex problem. I can explain why I chose pyqt .. what kind
of trouble I have found and how I solve it. Starting from python going to pyqt
and at the end how to deploy a python application with pyInstaller …

I also explain my actual project OpenPLM an OpenERP module to manage PLM data
into OpenERP

see you soon Matteo
