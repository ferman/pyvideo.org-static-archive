Python has been adopted by many disciplinary communities, showing its
adaptability to many problems. Scientific computing and web development are
two examples of such communities. These might, at first glance, seem to share
few common interests, especially at the level of algorithms and libraries.
However, at the level of integrated practice in time-constrained academic
environments, where framework development is less valued than research and
teaching productivity, ease of adoption of tools from each of these
communities can be tremendously valuable.

Using examples from the recently-deployed West Texas Lightning Mapping Array,
which is processed and visualized in real-time, this paper will argue that a
shared sense, among disciplinary communities, of the essence of how one
deploys Python for specific problems is beneficial for continuation and growth
of Python's status as a go-to language for practitioners in academic settings.
