New tools like the IPython notebook can enhance both lectures and textbooks, by making class time and individual study more interactive through the inclusion of executable code and animations.  I will demo some materials and activities I've provided for students using the IPython notebook.  I will focus on practical issues I've faced that are particular to this teaching approach.

&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Traditional university teaching is based on the use of lectures in class and textbooks out of class.  The medium (lecture or book) discourages the natural curiosity that can lead to deeper understanding by investigating the result of changing a parameter, or looking at the full results of a time-dependent simulation.  

The IPython notebook provides a single medium in which mathematics, explanations, executable code, and animated or interactive visualization can be combined.  Notebooks that combine all of these components can enable new modes of student-led inquiry: the student can experiment with modifications to the code and see the results, all without stepping away from the mathematical explanations themselves.  When notebooks are used by students in the classroom, students can quickly share and discuss results with the instructor or other class members.  The instructor can facilitate deeper learning by posing questions that students may answer through writing appropriate code, during class time.

For the past four years, I have taught a graduate numerical analysis course using SAGE worksheets and IPython notebooks.  I will show examples of the notebooks I've developed and successfully used in this course.  I will describe some practical aspects of my experience, such as:

 - Tradeoffs between using IPython and SAGE
 - Experiences with use of cloud computing platforms
 - Dealing with students' installation issues
 - Quickly getting students up to speed with the Python language and packages
 - Testing and evaluating homework in a math course that is programming-intensive</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">David I.

This tutorial will give participants an introduction to the use of IPython notebooks in teaching numerical methods or scientific computing, at the level of an undergraduate or graduate university course.  Prior familiarity with notebooks is not necessary.  Participants will create an interactive notebook that explains and helps students to implement and explore a numerical algorithm.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
This tutorial is targeted to those who are or soon will be teaching numerical methods or scientific computing and are interested in using Python as the programming language for their course.  The tutorial will be useful both to academics teaching university courses and those in industry who run training sessions.  No prior knowledge of the IPython notebook is necessary, but participants should have some familiarity with Python, Numpy, and Matplotlib.

IPython notebooks are an excellent medium for teaching nuemrical methods since they can include both mathematical explanations and executable code in a single document.  The tutorial will begin with an introduction to the IPython notebook, emphasizing how to overcome aspects that can be confusing to students.  Next we will go over available free resources for 

- ensuring that students have a suitable computing environment, using either a cloud platform or a packaged distribution
- distributing and collecting notebooks
- converting notebooks to other formats that may be useful in a course

We will also review a number of excellent existing resources containing IPython notebooks for numerical methods courses.  Using these notebooks as examples, we will discuss how to design effective notebooks for teaching, including

- typesetting mathematical equations and expressions using LaTeX
- Formatting, referencing, and layout using Markdown
- inserting complete or partial code snippets
- embedding figures and other media
- embedding interactive widgets

We will briefly discuss different approaches to using IPython notebooks in a course, including their use as the basis for

- homework assignments
- short activities during a class session
- longer laboratory sessions

Finally, participants will be asked to develop, individually or in small groups, a notebook of their own that could be used as an assignment, classroom exercise, or lecture.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Aron Ahmadia,David I.
