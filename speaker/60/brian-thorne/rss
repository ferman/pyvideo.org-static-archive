Computer Vision

Presented by Brian Thorne

Abstract

An introduction to computer vision in Python, from the general concept to its
implementation with some current open-source libraries (opencv, scipy,
pygame).

Outline

The purpose of my presentation is an introduction to computer vision (CV) and
image processing in Python. I will aim to show what is possible with current
libraries, demonstrate their usability, explore their limitations, and cover
elements of best coding practice. Firstly, I will briefly present the basics,
such as video grabbing, image processing and computer vision algorithms. I
will illustrate my presentation with the Python bindings to the opencv library
and show different examples such as displaying a video image, some filtering
algorithms (dilation, gaussian blur), and how to implement facial recognition.
I will describe after how related tasks can be achieved with other Python
tools such as scipy and pygame. I will show how these three libraries can be
used in conjunction to perform video capturing, image processing and user
interfacing. Finally, I will introduce my basic Python computer vision
framework, which is aimed at inexperienced users, and demonstrate it on the XO
laptop, the inexpensive low-powered sub-notebook distributed as part of the
One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative.

This talk will start with an overview of current methods of privacy preserving computation including homomorphic encryption, secret sharing, and differential privacy.

We will explore current uses of privacy preserving computation, in fields such as government, finance, telecommunications and IoT. We will look at the technological and social barriers to wider adoption then gaze into the crystal ball to see where the future might take us. 

To conclude we will explore one technique (partially homomorphic encryption) with a motivating medical example. A high level overview of the open source library `python-paillier` will be given along with a few code samples showing how easy (some) privacy preserving analytics can be to implement.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian Thorne</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3866/blind-analytics-getting-insight-from-data-witho</guid><enclosure url="http://youtu.be/zgCCtof4kkY" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zgCCtof4kkY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
