Python is used extensively in the video game industry at many levels. This talk is specifically about how Python based analytics can be integrated operationally into an organization at two levels: in ad hoc investigations and in production analytic services. This is about best practices in documented, reproducible and archived data investigations as well as production development with Python. A case study of an analytic service for cheating detection in Call of Duty Ghosts will make this real and provide some fun. This talk is rated PG-13 for some awesome video game violence.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Steve Lang</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3291/python-in-the-video-game-industry</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0nTEbsQRTE" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/A0nTEbsQRTE/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
