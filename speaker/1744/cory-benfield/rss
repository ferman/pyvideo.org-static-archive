If you write blocking code, you don’t care about efficiency.

There, I said it.

It’s 2015, and still the vast majority of Python programmers write essentially synchronous code that blocks on network I/O. This approach, while simple to reason about, struggles mightily with scaling up and out into software that does a lot of network I/O. Worse, it makes it difficult to write code that reacts rapidly to changing conditions.

The writing is on the wall for this kind of software, as the community shifts towards writing software that embraces asynchronicity. In this talk we’ll discuss why synchronous software is a problem, what your options are to move away from it, and what challenges are being faced by the Python ecosystem as we try to move towards a brave new asynchronous world.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Cory Benfield</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Sep 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3851/you-dont-care-about-efficiency-synchronous-code</guid><enclosure url="http://youtu.be/7b4z7y6Lohw" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7b4z7y6Lohw/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Hyperactive: HTTP/2 and Python</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3409/hyperactive-http2-and-python</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The internet has spoken, HTTP is to get its first serious update in 15 years. In this talk we'll discuss what HTTP/2 is, why it's happening, and how it's going to affect you and everyone you love. We'll briefly talk about how you can get started with HTTP/2, and some interesting projects associated with it, including Hyper, the first Python HTTP/2 library.
