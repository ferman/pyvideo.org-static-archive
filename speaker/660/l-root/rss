[EuroPython 2012] L Root - 5 JULY 2012 in "Track Spaghetti"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Are you a woman wanting to break into the engineering field? Or do you know
any women wanting to learn how to code, but don’t know how to help them?
Perhaps our nerdy ladies are a bit shy to ask for help. That’s okay! I’ll give
you some tools to nudge you in the right direction. In this session, Iâ??ll be
talking about how I increased womenâ??s engagement in the Python community
though demonstrating how versatile the language is with practical projects, by
creating a safe space for women to learn and to fail, and by encouraging
involvement beyond the classroom.
