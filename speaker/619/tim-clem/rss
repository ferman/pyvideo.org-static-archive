Come hear about the tools, technology, corporate structure, and ethos that
lets GitHub use GitHub to build GitHub. From a couple of guys in a coffee shop
to almost 100 employees, millions of users, and massive open source projects
that are powering businesses around the world, it's been a bit of a wild ride.
Hear about some lessons learned and challenges we've faced: things we've done
right and others that didn't work out so well. Learn a little bit about our
growing technology stack and how we design and deploy features. Get some
insight into why we still have no managers and how everyone decides what to
work on. Finally, hear about how open source has shaped the company and our
vision of 'open' in everything from hardware to politics to education and
science. The social web is old news, but the collaborative web is just in its
infancy and GitHub sees that as a very bright future.
