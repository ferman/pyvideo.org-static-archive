[EuroPython 2012] Ross Lawley - 5 JULY 2012 in "Track Spaghetti"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
MongoDB - from “humongous” - is an open source, non-relational, document-
oriented database. Trading off a few traditional features of databases
(Notably joins and transactions) in order to Achieve much better performance,
MongoDB is fast, scalable, and designed for web development. The goal of the
project is MongoDB to bridge the gap between key-value stores (which are fast
and highly scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which queries Provide rich
and deep functionality). This talk will introduce the rich feature set of
mongoDB and examine how easy it is to develop with using python. We’ll discuss
the various ODM’s solutions that really let you develop quickly and how
mongoDB can be used to easily scale.
