Rackspace is rolling out a new service to allow your cloud to scale on its own, called Auto Scale. Built on Monitoring, Auto Scale allows you to grow or shrink your fleet of resources as demand changes.

pyrax, a Python package for working with OpenStack-based clouds like Rackspace's, just released Auto Scale and Monitoring support with version 1.5.0.

I'll show how you can use pyrax to deploy servers and automatically add or remove them based on their usage.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian Curtin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2356/set-it-and-forget-it-auto-scale-on-rackspace</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvchipy/Set_it_and_forget_it_Auto_Scal.mp4" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvchipy/Set_it_and_forget_it_Auto_Scal.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0P5EvYI0Rk" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/-0P5EvYI0Rk/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>What is the Python Software Foundation?</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1791/what-is-the-python-software-foundation</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
To a lot of people, the Python Software Foundation is a black box. After years of being on the outside of the box, a few years on the inside have given a good look at what this foundation is and why it matters. Come see what the PSF is about, what it's doing, and what you can do to help.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brian Curtin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1791/what-is-the-python-software-foundation</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/What_is_the_Python_Software_Fo.mp4?Signature=lACJjzIVupLhGOPMXHHT0wom9IY%3D&amp;Expires=1363732403&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/What_is_the_Python_Software_Fo.mp4?Signature=lACJjzIVupLhGOPMXHHT0wom9IY%3D&amp;Expires=1363732403&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7Uw0bW1IUY" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/A7Uw0bW1IUY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Python 3.3.0 Release</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1417/python-330-release</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
Brian will cover the September 29th release of Python 3 (3.3.0) including some
highly technical details and importing information for the casual users. He
will go over some of the particular Window's stuff while leaving the talk's
focus on an assortment of cool stuff.

Formed in 2010, the PSF Sprints committee set out to support local communities
getting together to make great software by funding their sprints with up to
$300 USD. No matter the project, the PSF wants to help you contribute to the
Python ecosystem. Come see what we're doing, how we're doing it, who we've
supported, and see how you can take part as well.


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;

efforts on open source projects in the Python world. From working on Python
itself, to the vast array of projects in the community, we take great interest
in keeping you interested. We're also interested in buying you dinner,
providing a place to work at, and buying t-shirts or other goodies for sprint
attendees.

With nearly 1.5 million downloads per month, the CPython installers for
Windows account for a huge amount of the traffic through python.org, and
they're the most common way for Windows users to obtain Python. Take a look at
what's going on with Python on Windows and see what the road ahead looks like
for Python 3.3.

The Development of Python and You

Presented by Brian Curtin

Have an inside look at what it takes to work on CPython, from getting setup
with the source and navigating the bug tracker, to the best practices for
having your work accepted. We'll find, categorize, and fix an issue in Python
to get you started. This talk is ideal for those who are new to open source
projects or are interested in the Python development process.

Abstract

People from all backgrounds, users of all platforms, and developers of all
levels are necessary in the development of Python. From writing code to
documentation, it takes all kinds of people to make an impact. If you've used
Python, we need you, and what better place to get involved than at PyCon?

2010 saw a rise in the number of contributors to CPython, and the PSF stepped
in to support the efforts of those wanting to get involved. Are you up for the
challenge? This talk dives right into what it takes to get involved, covering
the who, what, where, when, and why of Python development, going through the
whole process live.

After the conference is over, stick around with the CPython crew and hack
away!
