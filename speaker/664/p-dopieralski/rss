[EuroPython 2012] P Dopieralski - 4 JULY 2012 in "Track Pizza Margherita"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
With the growth of AJAX and other client-side technologies many Python
programmers, web-applications increasingly involve large amounts of
JavaScript. Many of us find that, just to keep doing our job, we have
understand JavaScript better. This tutorial, which was also given at
EuroPython 2009, 2010 and 2011, provides an introduction to JavaScript that
emphasises the similarities and differences between Python and JavaScript. It
has a focus on the concepts underlying JavaScript, and in particular the
object model and the lack of built-in classes. It also covers quite a few
JavaScript gotchas and other traps for the unwary. This course is suitable for
those who are Beginners or better in Python. Previous JavaScript knowledge is
not required, but would helpful. This course was prepared and previously
delivered by Jonathan Fine. I was assisting in the course in 2010 as a helper
and worked a little on improving the materials during the sprints. I intend to
improve the materials further and bring them up to date with recent
developments in the JavaScript world, and then deliver the tutorial, because
Jonathan will not be attending the conference this year.
