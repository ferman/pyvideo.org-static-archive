Have you developed a mathematical model or computational / visualization
algorithm? Your algorithm could be useful worldwide to people who face a real-
world problem but do not want to write code. Professionals in industry,
scientists in other fields or researchers in developing countries can quickly
apply your work to their domain with a web-based cloud-computing platform like
CrossCompute.


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
CrossCompute is a site where you can run mathematical models and algorithms
submitted by researchers. If you are a researcher and you submit your
algorithm, you'll get paid each time it runs. We'll send you a URL where users
can run your model on their data as many times as they want. More users mean
more feedback that you can use to improve your model.

Here is an example: Suppose a mathematician in the US develops an operations
research model for placing schools in a community given the locations of
existing schools and households, and decides to charge ten cents each time it
runs. Then a business owner in Ghana runs the model over the internet to place
stores in his district, and saves money because he didn't have to hire a
consulting firm or buy a software package. Meanwhile, the mathematician in the
US uses the algorithm revenue to fund research to improve the model.

Now is an exciting time to get involved in data analytics for your city or
local government. Governments need to prioritize limited resources like
emergency response firefighters, police officers and city inspectors. I urge
you to contact your local Mayor's office to learn about the challenges they
are facing. Then, create a tool to make their life easier. You can send the
tool to support@crosscompute.com where it will join a growing collection of
analytics for the public good. You will get the credit for the algorithm, the
revenue and users from around the world.

Introduction to Parallel Computing on an NVIDIA GPU using PyCUDA

Presented by Roy Hyunjin Han

With Andreas Kl√∂ckner's PyCUDA, you can harness the massively parallel
supercomputing power of your NVIDIA graphics card to crunch numerically
intensive scientific computing applications in a fraction of the runtime it
would take on a CPU and at a fraction of the development cost of C++. We'll
cover hardware architecture, API fundamentals and several examples to get you
started.

Abstract

There are two approaches to parallelizing a computationally heavy procedure:
use a messaging queue such as AMQP to distribute tasks among a networked
cluster or increase the number of processors in a single machine. This talk
focuses on techniques for adapting mathematical code to run on specialized
multi-core graphic processors.

Modern graphic processors have hard-coded transistors for common vector and
matrix operations, making them ideal for general scientific computing.
However, the NVIDIA CUDA's unique design requires knowledge of its hardware to
adapt algorithms effectively. This talk covers basic CUDA architecture, API
functions and several examples to illustrate the different kinds of problems
that will benefit from parallelization.

How Python is guiding infrastructure construction in Africa

  
Presented by Roy Hyunjin Han (InvisibleRoads)

  
A whirlwind tour of the roles of different Python modules in the architecture
of a geospatial infrastructure planning system.

  
We used Python to transform an elaborate, multistep process for finding and
connecting households in villages into a single, streamlined planning
experience. I'll explain how Python's freely available libraries empowered a
small team of developers under a minimal budget and timeframe. Now just
imagine if we had to do the same thing with Java.
