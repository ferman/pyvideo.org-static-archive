Docker (http://docker.io) is the hot-new-thing out there for running your application in development and in production. Here at Infoxchange, we are extremely excited about how Docker allows a build-once, run-anywhere approach to moving applications from testing through to production. We are one of the first organisations to be using Docker in production on high-SLA applications.

In this talk we will present:

- a quick intro to Docker and how it solves our problems at Infoxchange;
- our interface for hosting applications on Docker ("pallet");
- how to build and develop a Python app on Docker;
- Infoxchange's Django settings module for the pallet interface;
- Forklift (https://github.com/infoxchange/docker-forklift), a tool we've developed for running and developing apps that use the pallet interface, in and out of a Docker container; and
- Extending forklift for your services.

If time permits we will try and cover the additional bonus topics:

- How to host your legacy mod_python application on Apache inside Docker with minimal changes; and
- Using Forklift to do automated full-stack integration testing of apps by spinning up containers of other apps (which we do in a container that is testing the built app that is running in a container that is our CI server... inception is possible).

The talk will be presented by Danielle Madeley and Alexey Kotlyarov.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Alexey Kotlyarov,Danielle Madeley</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3136/running-django-on-docker-a-workflow-and-code-by</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/19-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/19-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgL8r--p97s" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/SgL8r--p97s/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
