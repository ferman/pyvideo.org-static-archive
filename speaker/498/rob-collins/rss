[EuroPython 2011] Rob Collins - 22 June 2011 in "Track Ravioli "


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
We will look at the limitations of available rule engines when it comes to
complex pricing rules. Rob has been part of a Python team writing a pricing
engine based on network graphs. We will show:

  * Why pricing is not easy
  * Rule engine anti-patterns, e.g. to change one price requires a week's development time, and has to be fitted into a release cycle
  * How to make pricing rules data driven, usable by the business
  * How the use of graphs and sets reduces the complexity

Rob is joined by David Layton of Grey Squirrel Consulting, who is a fellow
contractor working with Rob on the pricing project. He is an American
expatriate and Python developer, currently living and working in London. His
background is in scientific computing, CRMs and Business Intelligence.
