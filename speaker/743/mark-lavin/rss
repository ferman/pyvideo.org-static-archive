Working in teams is an important part of what we do as developers &amp; designers. Whether it's desktop applications or mobile sites, we work together to create successful end products. But how do we work together in different environments? What is the best work-flow for a mix of skill sets?

We'll be talking about our various methods &amp; work-flows that we found successful in working collaboratively.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Julia Elman,Mark Lavin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1732/designers-developers-collaborating-on-your-pyt</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/Designers_Developers_Collabora.mp4?Signature=Fbe%2BpefqxiiSxqBH8hcBTLdr6CY%3D&amp;Expires=1363659044&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/Designers_Developers_Collabora.mp4?Signature=Fbe%2BpefqxiiSxqBH8hcBTLdr6CY%3D&amp;Expires=1363659044&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVvqLrSMtxI" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/VVvqLrSMtxI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Maintaining Your Sanity While Maintaining Your Open Source App</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1403/maintaining-your-sanity-while-maintaining-your-op</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
Django has a thriving community of open source pluggable applications.
Maintaining an external application can be a rewarding experience and doesn't
need to take over your life. Learn what it takes to package, document and test
your Django app so that others can use and contribute to what you've built.


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
## Introduction/Overview

So you want to release your Django app into the wild. Now what? I'll go over
packaging your application to add to the Python Package Index (PyPi), creating
documentation to host on Read The Docs and setup an environment to test your
application against different versions of Python and Django. I'll also go over
some things you should and shouldn't do when maintaining your app over the
years.

## Packaging

  * Creating a setup.py
  * Registering your package
  * Uploading your package
  * Sane versioning with PEP386

## Documentation

  * Getting started with Sphinx
  * Using Read the Docs

## Testing

  * Running your app tests
  * Testing multiple Python/Django versions with tox
  * Testing your documentation build

## Things to Do

  * State your goals
  * Let others help you
  * Include a license
  * Prepare for the future

## Things to Avoid

  * Rejecting every contribution
  * Accepting every contribution
  * Developer burnout

## Conclusion

Reusable applications are my favorite feature of Django. It does take work to
maintain an open source app but it can be quite rewarding. If you use these
tools you can help provide your users with the best experience and empower
them to help you with your application.
