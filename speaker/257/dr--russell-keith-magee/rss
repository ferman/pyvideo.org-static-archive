First steps in performance tuning

Presented by Russell Keith-Magee

So you've built your first Django website. You've tested it, you've released
it, you've got a few customers... and a few more... and a few more... and now
you're having performance problems. What do you do? This talk will look at
some performance problems you may experience, and show some simple (and
creative) ways to squeeze the most out of your server hardware.

Abstract

The talk is especially aimed at web developers that haven't got a background
in computing, but nonetheless have fallen into a web development role. Topics
will include:

  * How to work out that you have a problem 
  * Getting computation out of the request/response loop 
  * Caching -- when, how, and problems that caching introduces 
  * Setting up a webserver to avoid deadlocks 
  * Likely causes (and solutions) of database bottlenecks

So you want to be a core developer?

Presented by Russell Keith-Magee

The most important part of Django is its community of contributors -- without
contributors, Django would never improve. However, as a newcomer to Django,
the prospect of contributing may be somewhat daunting. This presentation will
show you how to make the transition from user to contributor -- what to do,
how to do it, and some guidelines on how to do the job well.

The aim of this presentation is to explain how we do things in the core, and
how to work with us to get the job done. It will cover dealing with Trac and
the triage lifecycle, how to find tickets to triage, other non-obvious ways to
contribute, and cover some basic design philosophies.
