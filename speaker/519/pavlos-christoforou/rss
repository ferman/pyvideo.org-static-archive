[EuroPython 2011] Pavlos Christoforou - 21 June 2011 in "Track Ravioli"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Point Nine provides operations outsourcing and support to large and complex
financial institutions.

As part of our day to day responsibilities we are required to process our
client's trading activity which generally involves receiving data in various
formats and through various protocols, apply transformations, validations and
enrichment processes and distribute the resulting data to various third
parties, in short Data Plumbing.

The goal of this talk is to introduce the audience to the (vast) field of
financial data processing which we believe presents a tremendous opportunity
for python and it's community and provide a brief overview of Point Nine's
deployment of Python as the main framework for all data plumbing activities.
