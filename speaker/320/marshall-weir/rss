Testing, Where Do I Start?

Presented by Marshall Weir

Marshall will cover basic unit test concepts and quickly move to making your
tests motivating, easy to run and adding testing to an existing project. He's
aiming squarely at developers who have projects they want to use testing for,
but don't know where to get started.

Have you wanted to become test-infected but couldn't find the start of the
thread to pull? Marshall will help.
