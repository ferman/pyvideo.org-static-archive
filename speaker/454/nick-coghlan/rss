When it comes to open source software, what do you want to be doing?
Do you want an occasional hobby where you can have fun contributing
back to the community? Have a significant impact on the world by being
able to commit full time to growing the available pool of free &amp; open
source software? Spend time getting to know the needs of a particular
organisation, and applying open source tools to solve their problems?
Or perhaps you'd prefer to understand the general needs of a broad
category of potential users, and design open source tools that will
solve their problems without customisation?

Getting involved in open source development communities can offer all
these opportunities and more, but it also makes it incredibly easy for
us to overcommit and burn ourselves out. If we're not careful, our
unrealistic expectations can also contribute to the burnout of our
peers. To ensure sustainability, we need to come to a shared
understanding of some of the different ways we can engage with open
source communities, what we can reasonably offer for free, and what we
should expect to be paid for.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nick Coghlan</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3764/contributors-colleagues-clients-customers-su</guid><enclosure url="http://64966d3674e0a64d8f4a-47c94b14ef8e1f83d5390cdb0629c6ed.r53.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2015/3764_Contributors_Colleagues_Clients_Customers_Sustaini.mp4" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://64966d3674e0a64d8f4a-47c94b14ef8e1f83d5390cdb0629c6ed.r53.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2015/3764_Contributors_Colleagues_Clients_Customers_Sustaini.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="http://youtu.be/LM4oNXTSpfE" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LM4oNXTSpfE/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Python's Transition to Multilingual Programming</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3976/pythons-transition-to-multilingual-programming</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
"Ugh, why does Unicode have to be so complicated? It's just text, why can't it be as simple as writing a note for myself?"

One of the more controversial changes in Python 3 is the decision to handle text data entirely as Unicode code points. In this presentation, CPython core developer Nick Coghlan will explore some of the background of that design decision, the capabilities it grants Python 3 over Python 2, and some of the related features of the upcoming Python 3.5 release.

These are interesting times for the Python packaging ecosystem, with the Python Packaging Authority (creators of the popular pip and virtualenv tools) emerging as the umbrella brand for a suite of related tools that will bring support for updated packaging standards to both the upcoming Python 3.4 and to existing versions of Python.

This talk will cover some of the history of Python's packaging tools and systems, where we are now, and where we aim to go in the future.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nick Coghlan</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2197/nobody-expects-the-python-packaging-authority</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/Nobody_Expects_the_Python_Pack.mp4" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/Nobody_Expects_the_Python_Pack.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xrdt3-YVz4" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8Xrdt3-YVz4/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Panel: Directions for Packaging</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1731/panel-directions-for-packaging</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;

experience to Python users? Several of the people working directly on
that problem will be here to answer your questions.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Daniel Holth,Ã‰ric Araujo,Jason R.

The PulpDist project uses SQL Alchemy as part of a custom JSON validator. This
could be seen as an unusual choice, so it's worth exploring the way this
approach came to be adopted. Practicing iterative development means coping
with the tension between "doing the simplest thing that could possibly work"
to meet immediate project requirements and avoiding "reinventing the wheel".


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The PulpDist project uses SQL Alchemy as part of a custom JSON validator. This
could be seen as an unusual choice, so it's worth exploring the way this
approach came to be adopted.

Practicing iterative development means coping with the inevitable tension
between "doing the simplest thing that could possibly work" to meet immediate
project requirements and avoiding "reinventing the wheel" in order to take
full advantage of existing software components.

This means that iterative software designs are inevitably path dependent:
decisions made in early iterations can shape later aspects of a project in
unexpected ways. These early influences may even predate the project itself,
instead being a consequence of wider organisational policies and the personal
preferences and abilities of key developers.

Understanding some of these factors can help with understanding why:

  * "good enough" is usually a better target than "perfect"
  * "Not Invented Here" syndrome is not always the villain it is frequently made out to be
  * the need to extensively rewrite existing components is not always a sign of past failure

This is a panel discussion in which Nick Coghlan, Raymond Hettinger and
Richard Jones discuss the state of Python 3, some of the new features, the 3rd
party adoption, migration strategies and open to the floor for questions.

The CPython reference interpreter lies at the heart of a much wider Python
ecosystem. The decisions that shape the future development of CPython ripple
out and have a broad impact on the entire Python community. This talk covers
the special place CPython occupies in the broader Python community, how the
decisions that affect CPython's development are made, and how new developers
can become involved in that process..
