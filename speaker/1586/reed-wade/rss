**Audience level**

Intermediate

**Description**

I will introduce the Bottle Python Web Framework and show how simple it is to configure a python web application to run under Nginx using uWSGI. I'll also demonstrate some lesser known features of uWSGI that let your web app work a little smarter.

**Abstract**

The Bottle Python Web Framework makes it easy to create a little web application. Nginx and uWSGI make it easy for your web app to scale and perform well. In this talk I'll describe how to create and configure an API focused web application.

I'll demonstrate some features of uWSGI which allow your web app to share data amongst separate processes and delegate work to non-client facing processes.

I'll show how all this can fit together with a full stack of: bottle+uWSGI+Nginx+Bootstrap+AngularJS
