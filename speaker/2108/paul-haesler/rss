More and more governments around Australia and the world are starting to talk the talk on Open Data as an essential component of open government.  But to what extent do they walk the walk?  CKAN based data repositories like data.gov.au (at the Australian federal level) provide powerful APIs for searching and discovering published data-sets, but at the end of all that search and discovery, the data-sets themselves sometimes make it clear that somebody somewhere has missed the point.

In developing dashboard applications for state and federal government agencies over the past 6 months, I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly not only in terms of API design and data set presentation, but also in terms of commitment to Open Data.
