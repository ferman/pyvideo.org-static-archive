Testing Demo

Presented by Michael Dunstan

Abstract

Live demo of writing code and tests.

Outline

This live demo is intended for people that have not seen test driven
development in action before. See what a failing test should look like. And
then I'll attempt to write some code to make that test pass so that you can
see what a successful test run looks like - I may need some help from the
audience at that point. Along the way you'll see various features of the test
framework 'nose' in action and even some doctests. This will be a second
attempt of the stunt first performed: [http://nzpug.org/MeetingsAuckland/Augus
