Flask is a Python web framework that is both lightweight and powerful. With an active community, and a diverse and versatile choice of plugins, Flask allows you to scale from simple single-URL websites through to highly complex website architectures. 

In this talk we will begin by setting up a simple Flask powered website and get it running on the Heroku PaaS. We will then demonstrate how to integrate Flask and SQLAlchemy (a powerful ORM) to allow database access and get this uploaded and working on Heroku as well.

Finally we will discuss some more advanced concepts and review a number of the Flask plugins to get you started on the path to building great web-based projects.

Graph and network structures are everywhere and can be found in social, biological and technological networks that impact us on a daily basis. Understanding, and exploiting, graphical structures creates opportunities for obtaining new analytic insights, implementing new computational paradigms, and better defining the relationship between objects of any sort.

Python provides access to these graph and network structures using the fantastic NetworkX library (http://networkx.github.io/) .  In this presentation we will give an introduction to the NetworkX library, showing how easy it is to build and exploit simple graphical and network structures.

From that starting point we will then discuss a number of more complicated, real world examples of how the NetworkX library can be used to:
 - Analyse social networks to extract valuable information about people / entities within those networks.
 - Implement reconfigurable processing pipelines (something we refer to as computational graphs) for data capture, processing and analytics.
 - Easily track the relationship between Python objects in a variety of other interesting and useful scenarios.

This presentation will be targeted at intermediate developers and no prior experience with graphs, networks or NetworkX is required. This presentation will offer an easy introduction to the world of networks and graphs in Python and will illustrate real world uses of this powerful and useful paradigm.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Lachlan Blackhall</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3132/graphs-networks-and-python-the-power-of-interc</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/29-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/29-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1q7FBxy1Rds" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/1q7FBxy1Rds/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
