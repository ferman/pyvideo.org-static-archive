Bokeh is a new plotting framework for Python that natively understands the
relationships in multidimensional datasets, uses a Protovis-like expression
syntax scheme for creating novel visualizations, and is designed from the
ground up to be used on the web.

Although it can be thought of as "ggplot for Python", the goals of Bokeh are
much more ambitious. The Grammar of Graphics primarily addresses the mapping
of pre-built aeshetics and layouts to a particular data schema and tuples of
measure variables. It has limited facility for expressing data interactivity,
and its small set of graph types (aka "geoms" or glyphs) are somewhat limited
in both their number and in the number of ways they can be combined with one
another.

On the flip side, most existing Python plotting frameworks adopt a "tell me
how" instead of a "tell me what" approach. Thus, user plotting code
canfrequently become mired down in what amounts to details of the rendering
system.

In our talk, we will show various features of Bokeh, and talk about future
development. We will also go into some detail about how Bokeh unifies the
tasks of describing data mapping, building data-driven layout, and composing
novel visualizations using a single, multi-purpose scene and data graph.
