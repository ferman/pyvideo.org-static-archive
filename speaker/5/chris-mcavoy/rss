Going Full Python -- Threadless

Presented by Chris McAvoy

Threadless is a 10 year old community based design company with an
overpowering love of witty t-shirts and a mission to 'inspire awesomeness.'
After 10 years of working primarily with PHP, Threadless has decided to use
Python as our base development language. The decision was 10% technical and
90% touchy feely. We know what a powerful community can do to a product, and
see the same sort of drive and passion in the Python community that we see in
our own design community. Python is the peanut butter to our jelly. We're
excited to share our jelly with you. Chris McAvoy, VP of Technology at
Threadless (and the founder of the Chicago Python Users Group), will share a
bit about the companies history, the role of technology in supporting the
community at the core of the business, and why Python and Threadless are going
to be totally BFF's.
