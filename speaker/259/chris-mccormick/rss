Python in Video Games and Multimedia Projects

Presented by Mr. Chris McCormick

This talk will cover several real-world uses of Python in cross platform video
game and multimedia projects, and the tips, tricks, and techniques I learned
along the way whilst working on those projects. I'll speak about the issues
involved in cross platform desktop dev with wxPython, interfacing with
multimedia programs using subprocess, spreading load with multiprocessing,
developing for the web on small devices with Django, and when and how to write
custom network servers using asyncore.

Infinite 8-bit Platformer is a Free Software multiplayer user-created-content
platform video game written in Pygame. It's a bit like a cross between a wiki
and a game, because the players can also create and edit the levels. In this
talk we will look at the development of the game over the last three years,
including what has changed since PyCon 2010. We'll examine the sound,
graphics, and networking architecture which is built upon pygame and asyncore
(PodSixNet).
