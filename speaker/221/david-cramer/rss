Learn from failures (and successes) around testing patterns and culture in a
growing company, both in amount of code, and number of engineers. We'll dive
into how DISQUS adopted testing, and the many challenges we've had to
overcome.


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Testing can be one of the more difficult concepts to pick up in a development
cycle. With the complexities of large projects, and even small projects,
writing effective, automated tests can take many times longer than writing the
code and testing it by hand.

This talk will explore the various patterns of testing that DISQUS has
implemented, and iterated upon over the last two years. It will describe how
testing has been used to speed up the product lifecycle, improve stability
through automation, and the culture shift required to get there. Most
importantly, it will cover the practices that have been put in place that have
helped ease the burden of writing tests.

Practice iterative development like the pros. Release sooner, faster, and more
often.

Continuous deployment (and testing) has started to become a reality for many
companies. It brings to light one of the many problems that face large product
teams, but also creates some of its own. This talk will focus on the pros and
cons of continuous deployment, how DISQUS switched from the recurring release
cycle to continuous releases, as well as providing tips and arguments for
adopting it in your workplace.

[EuroPython 2011] David Cramer - 21 June 2011 in "Track Spaghetti"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Building scalable web applications may seem like a distant problem, but the
problem is not thinking about it before it's too late. This talk will focus on
designing a scalable web application before it needs to be (and avoiding the
premature optimization dilemma). It will cover topics such as efficient usage
of your database, appropriate caching (and invalidation!), and what the
speaker considers as best practices.

Disqus: Serving 400 million people with Python

Presented by David Cramer and Jason Yan

Disqus, one of the largest Python applications on the web, will explain how
they deal with scaling complexities in a growing startup. Founded in 2007,
Disqus maintains a small engineering team reaching over 400 million users a
month. Being powered by Python has allowed quick iteration of the application,
without sacrificing code quality and performance. The talk will cover key
parts of the architecture and development process at Disqus, including
hardware, databases, and common bottlenecks.
