Thinking of writing a book? We are in the midst of a boom in interest in amateur programming, particularly among children. Brendan spent the most recent summer past using his blog python4kids.brendanscott.com as inspiration for a new project based instructional book, Python for Kids for Dummies (US release by Wiley this northern summer). This talk will provide an overview of the development cycle for the book both in respect of the book's content and the process involved in creating that content and shepherding it through the publisher's internal processes. 
Topics to be covered include engaging and negotiating with the publisher, the different functions provided by a publisher, project management of the writing, interacting with editorial and technical reviewers, integrating with an existing "house style", art requirements and cross platform issues. In relation to content, Brendan will discuss the thought that went into targeting the material to a kids audience and the challenges involved in structuring a narrative which wends its way through each of the concepts that need to be introduced and providing a motivation for each of them. This includes how the content was structured, what concepts were included and what were passed over, trying to balance material to maintain interest without overwhelming the readers, the tension between explanation and demonstration and how to remain mindful of the audience's limitations. The highs, the lows, the triumphs (getting it done!) and tragedies (whole chapters consigned to the pyre), it's all here.

Writing a program in Python targeting the Android environment is well within your reach with the use of third party kits such as Kivy and the Pygame Subset for Android.  

Kivy is an "Open source Python library for rapid development of applications" and comes with tools which allow Kivy based programs to be packaged as Android apks for deployment to Android devices.   In this session I will give an overview of the Kivy development and deployment process.  I will also draw inspiration from my successes and failures in developing Python programs with Kivy to highlight Kivy's strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncracies.   Code examples will be kept to a minimum, with a focus on illustrating the capabilities of the Kivy library and explaining how its parts work together. 

I will also reserve some time to discuss the Pygame Subset for Android and how it can be used to deploy Pygame based games to Android devices.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Brendan Scott</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3113/deploy-to-android-adventures-of-a-hobbyist-by-br</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/37-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/37-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KPcBOpC-rw" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4KPcBOpC-rw/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
