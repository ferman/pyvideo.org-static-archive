Cartopy is a Python package which builds on Proj.4 to define coordinate reference systems for the transformation and visualisation of geospatial data. It has a simple matplotlib interface for publication quality visualisation. This talk will outline some of cartopy's functionality and demonstrate some practical applications within the realm of scientific presentation of geospatial data.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The practice of representing geospatial data upon a flat surface is known as
cartography, and the topological implications of projecting fundamentally 3D
data onto a 2 dimensional surface has been the challenge of map-makers since
time immemorial. Geospatial visualisation software is often implemented without
consideration for the 3rd dimension and this commonly results in problems
around the dateline or at the poles. For small areas these problems are often
not apparent and mostly surmountable, but at a global scale, such as when
visualising output from GCMs (General circulation models), the underlying
representation must be addressed head-on in order to visualise the data
"impact free".

Cartopy is a Python package which builds on top of
Proj.4 to define coordinate reference systems for the transformation and
visualisation of geospatial data. As well as the fundamental transformations
there is also a matplotlib interface allowing easy generation of maps with the
same publication quiality expected of matplotlib. Cartopy employs several
techniques to handle geospatial data correctly, including true spherical
interpolation for raster data, and Shapely geometry interpolate-and-cut
transformations for geospatial vector data.

This talk will outline some
of the capabilities of cartopy, and continue onto its practical application
within the realm of scientific presentation of geospatial data.
