[Morepath](http://morepath.readthedocs.org) is a server web framework written with modern, rich client web development in mind. Why another new Python web framework in 2014? 

Because it can be done better: Morepath understands how to construct hyperlinks from models. Writing a generic view in Morepath is like writing any other view. With Morepath, you can reuse, extend and override apps as easily as you can construct them.

Even if you don't end up using Morepath, you will learn something about how the nature of web frameworks.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
[Morepath](http://morepath.readthedocs.org) is a new server web
framework written with modern, rich client web development in mind.

In the talk I will be discussing some core features of Morepath that
make it different:

* Its different take on routing and linking. Morepath has support
  to help you construct hyperlinks to models.
* Its view system: plain views, generic views, view composition.
* Morepath's approach to application construction allows application extension and overriding, and composition.

This talk will attempt to convince people to try Morepath. For those
unable or unwilling to try, I will communicate some design principles
behind Morepath which can be of help to any web developer.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Martijn Faassen</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2966/morepath-a-python-web-framework-with-super-power</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyDKMAWPyuY" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/gyDKMAWPyuY/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Spinning a Web Framework</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2416/spinning-a-web-framework</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
Over the years I've been exposed to a lot of ideas in web frameworks. Reflecting on these ideas is valuable when you build a new one, but also when you simply use an existing web framework.

In this talk I will discuss the slow genesis of Morepath, a micro web-framework with super powers that I've created, and discuss some of the ideas behind it, things I've learned, and also share some thoughts about the creative process.

The ideas behind Morepath are not revolutionary, but hopefully still make you think.
