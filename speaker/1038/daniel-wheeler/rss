Sumatra is a lightweight system for recording the history and provenance data for numerical simulations. It works particularly well for scientists that are in the intermediate stage between developing a code base and using that code base for active research. This is a common scenario and often results in a mode of development that mixes branching for both code development and production simulations. Using Sumatra avoids this unintended use of the versioning system by providing a lightweight design for recording the provenance data independently from the versioning system used for the code development. The lightweight design of Sumatra fits well with existing ad-hoc patterns of simulation management contrasting with more pervasive workflow tools, which can require a wholesale alteration of work patterns. Sumatra uses a straightforward Django-based data model enabling persistent data storage independently from the Sumatra installation. Sumatra provides a command line utility with a rudimentary web interface, but has the potential to become a full web-based simulation management solution. During the talk, the speaker will provide an introduction to Sumatra as well as demonstrate some typical usage patterns and discuss achievable future goals.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Daniel Wheeler</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2039/using-sumatra-to-manage-numerical-simulations-sc</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YJr9c-zSng" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/1YJr9c-zSng/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
