After many trails and tribulations, a few months ago I finally got my 10-year-old brother hooked on programming with Python. I posted a brief snippet on reddit's /r/learnpython about it and the post went over very well, with many people asking me for more in-depth instructions of and a sort of curriculum they could use. I have created that material and would like to expand upon it with this talk.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Eric Matzner</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3298/how-i-taught-a-10-year-old-to-love-python-and-pro</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqlYgDHNM-o" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MqlYgDHNM-o/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
