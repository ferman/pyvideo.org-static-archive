A lot of people have heard of Jython, some have tried it, but it seems few have actually deployed it in a corporate environment. In this talk I'll share my experiences in using Jython as a testbed for Java applications, for rapid prototyping in Java desktop and web environments, and for embedding scripting capabilities in Java products.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Not everyone gets paid to work with Python all the time, but if you find yourself in a Java project, there are good chances you could benefit from Python without throwing out the Java stack. Using Jython, you can do rapid prototyping without the long edit-compile-test cycles normally associated with large Java projects, whether on the web or the desktop, and when testing an application might become a nightmare of scaffolding in Java, a little Jython may be just what you need to be able to run your tests smoothly.

At the end of this talk, I will put on my politician´s hat and bring up the best - and worst - arguments to use to get permission to use Jython in a corporate environment. </description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Fredrik Håård</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2961/jython-in-practice</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAg-UuieTUw" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/VAg-UuieTUw/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
