Learning a new codebase

Presented by Justin Lilly

This talk will be on methods of reading code for comprehension. While the
project will be walking through various third-party Django apps, the
experiences and conclusions are drawn from joining a large, existing Django
project which lacked documentation.

Abstract

In the broadest sense, this talk is on how to read code. More than this, it is
a series of methods and practices which one can follow to get up to speed on a
new codebase. The subject of this talk will be open-sourced Django projects,
but many of the experiences which fuel this talk will be based on joining a
new team. It will cover tracing execution paths, finding the more interesting
portions of a codebase, as well as how to address any issues you may have
found in it.

Customizing your editor for maximum productivity

Presented by Justin Lilly

This will be an overview of the sorts of things that editors can offer to make
your programming life easier. It will also include specifics of how to get
these features working in a basic editor. (Vim or Emacs, yet undecided)
