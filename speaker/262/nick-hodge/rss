Keynote: Nick Hodge, "IronPython &amp; The Quest for the Holy Grail"

Presented by Nick Hodge

Language interoperability is one of the Holy Grails of programming languages.
Choose your language, choose your framework and freely exchange objects and
methods.

Is this Anarcho-syndicalism of application architecture? Are the serfs in the
fields of development teams rebelling against the rightful King of the Realm?

Is the Dynamic Language Runtime from Microsoft merely a French castle in the
Kingdom of England?

How does this all fit with the open source Knights of Ni that lurk in the
thickest of forests?

And the so-called Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, Ruby, really a weapon of mass
destruction?

Find out in Nick Hodge's keynote.

A Professional Geek at Microsoft in Australia, Nick spends his time with open
source communities showing off Microsoft open source cool and shiny toys.
Prior to Microsoft, Nick spent many a weekend over 3 years building an
internal sales management tool using Python, Excel and SAP to counter-act the
evilness of being a sales manager. Please do not ask about these dark times in
polite conversations. More info about Nick may or may not be found at
