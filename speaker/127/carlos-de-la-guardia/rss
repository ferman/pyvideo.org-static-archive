Pyramid is a web framework designed to do very well the fundamentals of web applications. Even though it's minimalist in its goals, it provides strong features to let developers deal with these fundamentals. In this talk, we'll look at 5 specific Pyramid features that offer web developers unique flexibility and power. </description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Carlos de la Guardia</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1673/5-powerful-pyramid-features</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/5_powerful_pyramid_features.mp4?Signature=3Eupx7GWNqXnRhR%2B%2FFR%2BJDL9k24%3D&amp;Expires=1363647343&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/5_powerful_pyramid_features.mp4?Signature=3Eupx7GWNqXnRhR%2B%2FFR%2BJDL9k24%3D&amp;Expires=1363647343&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMx-kkJgoPM" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i4.ytimg.com/vi/kMx-kkJgoPM/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Patterns for building large Pyramid applications</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/707/patterns-for-building-large-pyramid-applications</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
Pyramid is a very flexible framework, but when dealing with large projects and
multiple developers it pays to establish a few ground rules and follow some
conventions. In this talk we'll discuss some patterns for organizing and
developing a large Pyramid application.

Pyramid is the web framework at the core of the Pylons Project. It's a "pay
only for what you eat" framework. You can get started easily and learn new
concepts as you go, and only if you need them. It's simple, well tested, well
documented, and fast. This course will present Pyramid and lead you through
the creation of a an application as the concepts from the framework are
introduced.

The Pyramid FAQ

Presented by Carlos de la Guardia

The #pylons IRC channel is the most common way of giving support to users of
the Pyramid framework. In this talk we take away some of the most often
discussed topics in the channel and give detailed answers to them.

Abstract

Every development project has a few questions and doubts that seem to come up
on its support channels every now and then. The Pyramid framework is no
exception.

In this talk, we introduce Pyramid related FAQs using the chat logs and
proceed to discuss them in detail. Showing the logs allows us to give the talk
a lighter side and makes for an introduction to each topic based on real user
questions.

Topics covered here include:

  * Configuration objects. 
  * Object traversal versus URL dispatch. 
  * Context and views. 
  * Authentication and authorization. 
  * How much 'Zope stuff' is there in Pyramid and can we take it away? 
  * Examples of how Pyramid enables the Pylons philosophy of integrating best of breed or preferred components. 
  * The future of Pyramid and Pylons.

Pay only for what you eat: A tour of the Repoze.BFG repository and philosophy

  
Presented by Carlos de la Guardia

  
BFG is a Python web application framework based on WSGI. It is a "pay only for
what you eat" framework. Meaning that you can get started easily and learn new
concepts as you go, and only if you need them. It's simple, well tested, well
documented, and fast. It also tries to make development fun.

  
This talk will introduce the framework and its philosophy, including
similarities and differences with other frameworks. I will then show some of
the software available in its repository and discuss the inclusive, loose
connection approach that the BFG community prefers for creating a flexible web
development platform.
