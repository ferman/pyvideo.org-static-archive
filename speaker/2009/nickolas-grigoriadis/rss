We all know writing documentation is an arduous exercise. We all know how useless and frustrating out-of-date or just plain incorrect documentation is. In this talk I'd like to demonstrate how Python can help make writing documentation, keeping it up-to-date and verifying its validity. It can be surprising what happens when other people discover your little-but-well-documented API.
Python has several built-in concepts and standard tools to help making this easier, such as docstrings, help(), Sphinx, Sphinx plugins, Doctests and generating documentation off tests themselves.
I'll focus on not only using Sphinx as a tool, but also on how to structure your application/library/tool so as to make writing accurate documentation as simple as possible.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nickolas Grigoriadis</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3839/how-python-helps-writing-documentation-less-painf</guid><enclosure url="http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful.thumbs/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-_000150.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
