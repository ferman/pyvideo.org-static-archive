There is an ever present rift between designers and developers and it is one
that has existed since our paths started crossing. We'll talk about how to be
mindful of design in your own open source project and how to attract designers
to help your project become even more awesome.


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
There is an ever present rift between designers and developers and it is one
that has existed since our paths started crossing. While it has almost become
a requirement for designers to be able to grok the code they work with on a
daily basis, that has unfortunately had no effect on the willingness of
designers to work on open source projects.

Fortunately, if your project is in need of a designer, there are ways that you
can make your project more appealing to our “special breed” of personality. In
this quick talk, we’ll jump into the mind of your typical designer, show you
just how many similarities we share and then apply that knowledge to make your
project easy and appealing for designers to jump into.
