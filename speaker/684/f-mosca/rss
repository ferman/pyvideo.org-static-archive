[EuroPython 2012] F Manfredi F Mosca - 4 JULY 2012 in "Track Ravioli"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The RestFS is an experimental project to develop an open-source distributed
filesystem for large environments. It is designed to scale up from a single
server to thousand of nodes and delivering a high availability storage system
with special features for high i/o performance and network optimization for
work better in WAN environment. The Restfs is pure-python, but several of the
libraries that it depends upon use C extensions (sometimes for speed,
sometimes to interface to pre-existing C libraries). The Project is on the
beginning stage, with some technology previews released. The main
characteristics of the RestFS are : - Scalability, no limits on storage and
clients size - High availability, no single point of failure and data
replication - Adaptative, load balancing and uniform distribution - High
Performance, parallel transfer, local cache consistency , data transfer by
difference - Flexible, S3 compatibility interface, dedicated library for
integration in web server and application layer This talk describes the
architecture, internals of RestFS and comparison among different free software
solutions. The session will discuss our experience in this development and
detailed information on performance and scalability RestFS Introduction RestFS
