Matt's obsession with Python's rich comparison methods started about 6 years ago with a gnarly bug and some bad assumptions. A few long nights and a lot of reading later, the docs corrected my assumption:

There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false.
Mind == blown and mind != blown. In Getting Rich with Comparison Methods we'll start by learning how to avoid common and costly bugs in your rich comparison methods, learn a bit about which methods are executed in comparisons and why, and then go beyond symmetrical comparisons exploring some of the ways we can take full advantage of asymmetrical comparison methods.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Matt Story</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3302/getting-rich-with-comparison-methods</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcVQveUjq8U" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RcVQveUjq8U/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
