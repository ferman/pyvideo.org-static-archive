At Braintree, we've moved away from using Python. We've always used Ruby as our primary language, but Python used to be the go-to choice for things where Ruby wasn't a good fit. I will discuss the problems we've had with Python, why we decided to move to other solutions, and what we've chosen instead. Finally, I'll talk about where we're continuing to use Python and what the future holds.  </description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Forsyth</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3788/python-not-recommended</guid><enclosure url="http://64966d3674e0a64d8f4a-47c94b14ef8e1f83d5390cdb0629c6ed.r53.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2015/3788_Python_Not_Recommended.mp4" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://64966d3674e0a64d8f4a-47c94b14ef8e1f83d5390cdb0629c6ed.r53.cf2.rackcdn.com/pygotham-2015/3788_Python_Not_Recommended.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="http://youtu.be/q74pI8hb_1U" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/q74pI8hb_1U/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>The Chicago Process: How Braintree Develops Software</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2552/the-chicago-process-how-braintree-develops-softw</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
Braintree needs to be highly available and secure, while still maintaining a rapid development pace and strict backwards compatibility. In order to achieve that, we use what has become known as the "Chicago Process". This involves pairing, strict TDD, a team structure, and weekly iterations, all to empower the devs to make decisions and get work of a high quality done while avoiding siloing.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Forsyth</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2013 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2552/the-chicago-process-how-braintree-develops-softw</guid><enclosure url="http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/chipy/2552_The_Chicago_Process_How_Braintree_Develops_Softwar.mp4" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/chipy/2552_The_Chicago_Process_How_Braintree_Develops_Softwar.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBTRRVr3AIQ" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/eBTRRVr3AIQ/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Getting the most out of Stack Overflow</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2216/getting-the-most-out-of-stack-overflow</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
Stack Overflow is the single greatest repository of coding knowledge in the world. Now approaching five years old, its community-moderated, strict Q&amp;A format has made it far more useful than other similar sites.

Contributing to it, however, can be intimidating. The questions of new users are often voted down or closed with little comment, or edited by the community in was the original poster doesn't understand. Answering is even worse. How do other people manage to post a detailed answer to a specific question in minutes, or even seconds? How could I possibly know so much about such a broad range of topics, even within a single programming language or framework?

Over the past three years, I've learned a lot from contributing to Stack Overflow. It has honed my research, technical writing, and rapid prototyping skills, as well as greatly expanded my knowledge of the Python ecosystem, standard library, and CPython internals.

I'll share not only how to use the site to learn, but also how to compete effectively with the thousands of other programmers who answer questions there on a daily basis -- we all like to win. I'll talk about what goes into a good answer, as well as a good question. I'll also talk about how contributing to Stack Overflow is like contributing to any other open source project in many ways -- in what you gain, as well as what the community gains, partly because of the CC-by-SA licensing used by the Stack Exchange network of sites.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Forsyth</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2216/getting-the-most-out-of-stack-overflow</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/Getting_the_most_out_of_Stack_.mp4" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/Getting_the_most_out_of_Stack_.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSULRDoF8-g" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/CSULRDoF8-g/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
