Spatial Interaction Modelling is a method for calibrating parameters for components within a system of flows, such as migration or trade, and then using those parameters to estimate new flows. Despite their popularity, a unified Python framework to employ them does not exist. In response, pySI was created as a coherent tool for calibrating models and simulating flows for a variety of models.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Functions from libraries such as scipy.optimize, scipy.spatial, statsmodels,
and numdifftools comprise the core of the pySI.calibrate routines, which are
automatically constructed depending upon the specified model inputs. As a
result, the user can focus on identifying different flow systems  and
understanding the associated spatial processes, rather than the algorithmic
divergences which emerge between different models. After calibration is
completed, the estimated parameters and their diagnostic statistics can be
reported in a uniform fashion.  Using functions within pySI.simulate, the
parameter estimates can act as inputs in order to predict new flows. More
recently developed models, which do not require input parameters, are also made
available, allowing comparisons amongst results from differing conceptual
formulations. Finally, results may be visualized with plots and networks via
matplotlib, igraph, and networkx. Overall, the pySI framework will increase the
accessibility of spatial interaction modelling while also serving as a tool
which can help new users understand the associated methodological intricacies. 

Within this presentation, the concept of spatial interaction and a few key
modelling terms will first be introduced, along with several example
applications. Next, two traditional techniques for calibrating spatial
interaction models, Poisson generalized linear regression and direct maximum
likelihood estimation will be contrasted. It will then be demonstrated how this
new framework will allow users to execute either form of calibration using
identical input variables, which are based upon a pandas DataFrame
specification, without any significant mathematical or statistical training.
Results from two different conceptual models will be compared to illustrate how
pySI can be used to explore different methods and models of spatial
interaction.
