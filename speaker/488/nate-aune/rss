How can you avoid servers and get back to coding? Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) makes deployment easy. But which PaaS do you choose and how do you get started? This talk will examine several of the leading PaaS providers and discuss their pros/cons. We'll also give examples for how to deploy the same app to each of them to see the differences.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Nate Aune</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1776/deploy-your-python-app-in-5-min-with-a-paas</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/Deploy_your_Python_app_in_5_mi.mp4?Signature=wcsy07i12q1OICu%2FKpFXaN9JZxQ%3D&amp;Expires=1363669286&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/Deploy_your_Python_app_in_5_mi.mp4?Signature=wcsy07i12q1OICu%2FKpFXaN9JZxQ%3D&amp;Expires=1363669286&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJcFsaVu8HI" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/eJcFsaVu8HI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Deploying web applications to the cloud with Python</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1026/deploying-web-applications-to-the-cloud-with-pyth</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
How can Python help you deploy web applications to the cloud? Amazon EC2
provides virtual machines on demand but as a developer you still have to
configure these machines and push your code to them. Fabric is a Python
library that lets you execute commands on a remote machine, and Boto is a
Python library for interfacing with Amazon web services. By using Fabric and
Boto, you can easily create repeatable deployments and provision new resources
as needed with minimal effort.

This talk will introduce Amazon Web Services and how to launch new machines
using simple Boto scripts, and how to get started making your own repeatable
deployments using Fabric scripts.

[EuroPython 2011] Anna Callahan,Nate Aune - 24 June 2011 in "Track Spaghetti"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Mobile apps are the hot item of the day - and the best mobile apps are backed
by a great website. Python web developer Nate Aune and iPhone developer Anna
Callahan will show you how we built a simple music web app in Django with a
native iPhone app that communicates with it. Attendees of this talk will see a
concrete case study of building an application that exposes an API for mobile
devices.

Our web app exposes a JSON API for sending and receiving data from the mobile
device. We’ll talk about why we chose Django and the TastyPie API package, and
discuss other Python-based frameworks that could be used to build the API such
as Pyramid, Flask and Bottle. We’ll also compare REST and custom APIs to
understand best practices for building APIs designed for mobile devices.
