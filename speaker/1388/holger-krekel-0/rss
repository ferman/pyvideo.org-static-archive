This talk discusses good ways to organise packaging and testing
for Python projects.  It walks through a per-company and an
open source scenario and explains how to best use the
"devpi-server" and "tox" for making sure you are delivering
good and well tested and documented packages.  As time permits, we also
discuss in-development features such as real-time mirroring and
search.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The talk discusses the following tools:

- devpi-server for running an in-house or per-laptop python package server

- inheritance between package indexes and from pypi.python.org public packages

- the "devpi" client tool for uploading docs and running tests 

- running of tests through tox 

- summary view with two work flows: open source releases and in-house per-company developments 

- roadmap and in-development features of devpi and tox 

(The presenter is the main author of the tools in question). </description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">holger krekel</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2960/packaging-and-testing-with-devpi-and-tox</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_YjaODzM1E" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/s_YjaODzM1E/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
