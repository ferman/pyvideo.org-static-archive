Get started with Zope3

Presented by Roman Joost

Abstract

The talk introduces Zope 3, the main differences to Zope (2) and how to get
started.

Outline

The Zope application server exist for nearly a decade now. One of the biggest
changes to the Zope architecture was the rewrite of the framework and an
introduction of a component architecture. Zope 3 was born. The talk covers how
developers can bootstrap a Zope 3 project using buildout, what the differences
between Zope (2) and Zope 3 is, how views and models are created and
registered, how third party applications are used and how common pitfalls can
be avoided.

Grok or how Zope3 reinvented itself

Presented by Roman Joost

Abstract

The talk introduces how to quickly and easily create web applications with
Grok, a web framework based on Zope3
([http://grok.zope.org/](http://grok.zope.org/)).

Outline

Grok is a web application framework based on Zope 3 - the popular application
server. One of the main aspects of Grok is the rapid development of web
applications without losing the flexibility Zope 3 provides. The talk covers a
quick introduction to Zope 3 and Grok. Based on an example, I will provide a
quick walk through on how easy it is to create sophisticated web applications
with Grok. Additionally, the talk outlines pitfalls for newcomers and how to
avoid them.
