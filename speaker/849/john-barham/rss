&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Presentation will go in-depth on the architecture of a web application service
built on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure, including:

  * developing a responsive, high-performance web application in Django
  * implementing a REST API for automating the web application
  * using Python's networking capabilities to monitor and aggregate log files from multiple remote servers in real time
  * automating deployment in Python using fabric
  * interacting with AWS using the boto library

From a business point of view I will also talk about the opportunities that
modern cloud computing platforms present to developers and how to best exploit
them.
