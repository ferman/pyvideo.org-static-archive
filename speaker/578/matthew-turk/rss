We present a new method for distributing and using Python that requires no dependencies beyond the Google Chrome web browser based on Portable Native Client (PNaCl).  We will demonstrate an IPython notebook run completely client side with no out-of-browser components, backed by Google Drive, an HTML5 File System, and able to pass numpy arrays as typed arrays without serialization as JSON.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
We present a new method for distributing and using Python that requires no
dependencies beyond the Google Chrome web browser.  By combining the static
linking methodology of traditional supercomputer-style deployments of Python
with the technology Portable Native Client (PNaCl) we have constructed a method
for building, deploying, and sharing fully-sandboxed scientific python stacks
that require no client-side installation: the entire IPython notebook and
scientific python stack, in a website, at native speeds.  We will present this
technology, along with some of its potential applications, describing its
shortcomings and future extensibility.  We will conclude by demonstrating an
IPython notebook run completely client side with no out-of-browser components,
backed by Google Drive and an HTML5 File System, and able to pass numpy arrays
as typed arrays into the browser without serialization as JSON.

1. We will begin by briefly describing the problems with deploying scientific python
as a stack, particularly the dependency graph, installation time, and so
on.

2. We'll describe the PNaCl technology and build system for
scientific python, including how individuals can create their own .pexes with
their own application stack

3. We'll describe potential applications,
such as bundling safe, sandboxed executables with scripts and lessons

4. We will demonstrate a complete system for running the IPython notebook in a
sandboxed, Google Chrome window

5. We'll conclude by describing methods that this system could be extended to run sandboxed python executables on any
system, independent of the Chrome web browser, such as supercomputers and
non-virtualized hosting providers

The usage of the high-level scripting language Python has enabled new
mechanisms for data interrogation, discovery and visualization of scientific
data. We present yt ( [http://yt-project.org/](http://yt-project.org/) ), an
open source, community-developed astrophysical analysis and visualization
toolkit for both post-processing and in situ analysis of data generated by
high-performance computing (HPC) simulations of astrophysical phenomena. We
report on successes in astrophysical computation through development of
analysis tasks, visualization, cross-code compatibility, and community
building.
