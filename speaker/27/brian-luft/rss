A Little South Sanity

Presented by Brian Luft

South is a useful tool in agile development environments, but learning to use
it effectively can take some practice. In this demo-driven talk we'll walk
through some common workflow examples, dissect a couple pitfalls, and call out
the relative strengths and weaknesses of South as a tool at each step. Finding
South's sweet spot for your environment will give you the best results.

Breaking down the process of building a custom CMS

Presented by Yann Malet, Brian Luft

The purpose of this talk is to share some of the important insights gained
over a couple years of working on custom CMS-type projects serving large
organizations. Acknowledging that approx. 30 minutes is a short time to cover
a broad subject, the focus of the talk would be on outlining a basic strategy
for managing large projects.

Abstract

Over the past couple of years, Brian and Yann's team have built and worked on
several large Django projects for large organizations. They will discuss how
to start and manage large CMS projects, with an emphasis on pointing people to
the best reference information and breaking down the common operations.

The primary discussion topics would cover:

  * Breaking Down the Job: Over the course of the project you'll end up accounting for thousands of details; here's how to figure out the first few Centering Around a Prototype: Hedging your bets for the inevitable "give me a ballpark figure" 
  * Dealing With Legacy Data Stores: Migrate legacy information early and often. 
  * Selecting 3rd Party Components: Reuse exiting app, fork it early or Trailblaze 
  * Bad News: Django Ain't Perfect - where it has weaknesses and how to compensate 

At the end of this talk the audience will be able to:

    * Break down this type of project into meaningful phases 
    * Migrate large dataset to populate the django models that are still under development. 
    * Have a rational and objective approach to select django reusable component and understand how to refine them during the different stages of the project lifecycle. 
    * Find and evaluate quality information about the tradeoffs Django presents in these types of projects

Data Herding: How to Shepherd Your Flock Through Valleys of Darkness

Presented by Brian Luft

Learn how to use common tools like the management shell, django-extensions,
and iPython to craft an effective workflow whether you're building a new
schema or migrating from old systems. We'll also look at how to take advantage
of the latest ORM features.

Abstract

The presentation would consist of walking through a few example scenarios
where one would deal with processing or converting data in some manner. For
example, migrating from a large legacy database often brings a number of
tedious problems. I would demonstrate how to work in an iterative, repeatable
style using the Django sql management commands, a few iPython tricks, etc.

Another demonstration would be showing a team workflow for South migrations,
illustrating how to deal with some common problems that crop up in practice.

The audience will leave with some solid techniques for dealing with a few
specific data management challenges. The unifying philosophy throughout is to
break large, difficult problems into small, repeatable steps and audience
members should also come away knowing how to select tools that help them work
in this style.

Treehugging

Presented by Brian Luft

Hierarchical data sprouts up almost everywhere, but not all trees look alike.
Learn to how tell them apart and love them all in Django.

Abstract

This talk would cover some common examples of hierarchical data in web
applications and then review solutions like django-mptt and django-treebeard.
Rather than trying to cover tree algorithms in-depth, the focus would be on
best practices for querying and rendering trees in your Django apps.

This talk is not geared for the smart kids; they already know this stuff. It
is intended to help less experienced developers take advantage of patterns
without needing to worry about the deeper concepts.
