Hg and Git: Can't we all just get along?

Presented by Scott Chacon

There is a fair amount of unnecessary animosity between developers about
version control systems, especially between Mercurial and Git users. In
reality, these two systems are very similar and can actually cooperate pretty
well. In this talk we will show just how similar Git and Mercurial are, look
at some of their technical differences, and see how they can work together by
looking at hg-git, the bidirectional Git/Mercurial bridge, implemented in
Python.
