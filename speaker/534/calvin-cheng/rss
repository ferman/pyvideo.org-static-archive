[EuroPython 2011] Calvin Cheng - 22 June 2011 in "Track Tagliatelle "


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
We had the privilege of working on a mobile web application for ETH Zurich,
funded by ETH North-South Centre, using Django/Postgis, jQuery mobile and
Openlayers technology.

In this talk, I would like to share what we have learnt technically and the
experiences and fun we had with polygon creation on a map and saving polygon
vertices and related data into our spatial database via geodjango.

This mobile web app is developed based on research by Dr Koh of ETH Zurich,
specializing on Matrix-calibrated and edge-corrected species-area models that
allow users to evaluate the biodiversity consequence and trade-offs of land-
use decisions. The development and description of these models were published
in Conserv. Biol. 24, 994 and J. Appl. Ecol. 47, 1063.
