Firefox Sync

Presented by Tarek Ziadé

Firefox Sync let you access your history, passwords, bookmarks and even open
tabs across all your devices, while remaining unreadable on the server through
encryption. After a brief introduction on the Sync protocol, this talk will
focus on the server, which is written in Python.

Abstract

The talk will briefly explain how Syncing works then will focus on the Server
architecture and code. You will discover through this talk how the server was
built and what technologies it uses.

  1. Firefox Sync in numbers 
  2. How synchronisation happens - the big picture 
    1. Desktop
    2. iPhone (Firefox Home)
  3. How encryption works
  4. Overview of the APIs 
    1. Sync 1.1
    2. User 1.0
  5. Server architecture 
    1. User &amp; Data storage
    2. Web Services
    3. Libraries used
  6. Scaling and benchmarking
    1. Grinder

The state of Packaging

  
Presented by Tarek Ziadé

  
The Python Package Index (PyPI) became over the last years an essential tool
to share your Python programs. As long as you use Distutils standards, you can
register and upload your work at PyPI in a few seconds.

  
Projects like Setuptools and Pip added great features on the top of this : the
ability to fetch PyPI to install a project and its dependencies. So you can
"easy_install A-Program" and everything is done automatically for you.

  
But all these features have shown the flaws and limitations of the current
Distutils design, and the urgency to make it evolve with respect to the
existing OS-specific packaging systems.

  
This talk will detail the biggest issues that need to be solved, and the work
that is being done. It will end up with a presentation of the Distutils
roadmap, and an overview of the Distribute project, the Setuptools replacer.
