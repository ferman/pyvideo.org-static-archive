[EuroPython 2011] Andrii Mishkovskyi - 22 June 2011 in "Track Lasagne"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Ever wondered how web maps are created? Ever wondered if you could build
something like Google Maps over a weekend? You probably can't, but this talk
will show you the basics of what you need to know, such as importing data,
rendering maps and even building simple routes. And all of this in Python!

Abstract: * Learning how OSM data looks * Parsing and importing the data *
Rendering maps with Mapnik * Bits of code required to build geocoder *
Building simple router with Python and PostGIS * And anything else I forgot to
mention in this abstract but will talk about

Definitions: OpenStreetMap - the so-called "Wikipedia of maps" project, with
thousands of contributors who edit the map data of the whole world. Unlike
similar projects, the map data is completely free (both as in beer and as in
speech) and thus anyone can make use of it. Mapnik - rendering framework,
created specifically for OpenStreetMap, written in C++ and Python. PostGIS -
an extension of PostgreSQL database, with support for many useful GIS
features.
