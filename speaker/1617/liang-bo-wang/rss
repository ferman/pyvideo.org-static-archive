We all start our programming with single process in mind. But parallelization from scratch is a real headache. Things get worse when it comes to writing a spaghetti code in both short time and high performance, which is often the case doing data analysis.

In fact, cases like computation under different conditions, programs can be easily parallelized (distributed) with a few modifications using existed library like multiprocessing, IPython Parallel, and Celery.

This talk makes you not afraid of parallel or distributed computing and provides ways for different level of parallelization from single machine, cluster, to cluster with task queue. I will only talk about the basic scenario, which should be easier for newbies to try on and understand how powerful these tools can be.

A machine learning example will be given in the end to compare performance and possible issues with different implementations.

Statistics is essential to data analysis, and many people choose R because of its great package diversity. With the advent of pandas, Python becomes one of the hottest language to do data analysis, and it will be more helpful if we can do statistics in Python as well. 

In this talk, I will first introduce how to do statistics in Python using statsmodel and some related functions implemented in Numpy and Scipy. 

Then I will introduces the communication from Python to R using rpy2, and give you advices or alternatives about when to use this approach or not.
