This talk is about several approaches to implement high performing numerical algorithms and applications in Python. It introduces into approaches like vectorization, multi-threading, parallelization (CPU/GPU), dynamic compiling, high throughput IO operations. The approach is a practical one in that every approach is illustrated by specific Python examples.

This talk is about several approaches to implement high performing numerical algorithms and applications in Python. It introduces into approaches like multi-threading, parallelization (CPU/GPU), dynamic compiling, high throughput IO operations.

The approach is a practical one in that every approach is illustrated by specific Python examples.

The talk uses, among others, the following libraries:

* NumPy
* numexpr
* IPython.Parallel
* Numba
* NumbaPro
* PyTables</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Yves Hilpisch</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3001/performance-python-for-numerical-algorithms</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkaIUvM5GXo" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/BkaIUvM5GXo/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Derivatives Analytics with Python &amp; Numpy</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1025/derivatives-analytics-with-python-numpy</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
[EuroPython 2011] Yves Hilpisch - 24 June 2011 in "Track Ravioli "


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
In financial engineering and derivatives analytics, C/C++/Java/VBA and other
languages are still dominating. Visixion has developed with
[DEXISION](http://www.dexision.com) the first full fledged derivatives
analytics suite with Python as core language.

DEXISION is an On Demand application that is completely Open Source based
(LAMP). For derivatives valuation, it uses Monte Carlo simulation - an
approach known to be computationally demanding. However, Numpy provides the
performance and functionality needed to implement financial simulation
algorithms in a fast and compact manner.

The talk illustrates the architecture of our analytics suite and demonstrates
how to implement fast and compact simulation algorithms with Python and Numpy.
The talk shows that the Python/Numpy combination reaches sufficient speed for
productive financial applications - something still widely doubted.

[No prerequisites.]
