Facebook leverages in-memory data stores extensively.  Even though caching is a conceptually simple service, several problems inherent to our scales make the deployment of our in-memory data store particularly interesting and challenging.

Montréal-Python is a user-group formed in 2007. It has since then grown into a
thriving community with code sprint and regular meetings attracting over 50
attendees. This talk will present history of the group and will highlight the
key factors behind its success with the hope to inspire others to replicate
that accomplishment.


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
The talk will first walk the audience through the factors inherent to Montréal
itself and how it affected other user groups before Montréal-Python. These
groups inspired us to get a group of Python hackers started the presentation
will show how we were able to leverage on the success of other user groups to
bring our young community forward.

The various stages of our growth will be presented along with insights on how
we managed to find speakers and venues at each point. The presentation will
then go through an overview of our current activities, sharing in the process
how effective they are in engaging the community. Our plans for the next few
years will be presented then a summary will provide advice to anyone who would
like to get started organizing a local Python user group.
