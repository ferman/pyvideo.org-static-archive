Lap Around IronPython

Presented by Sarah Dutkiewicz

It's not just C# and VB.NET that can be used in WinForms, WPF, Silverlight,
and ASP.NET. You could also use IronPython! In this session, you will get a
quick overview of IronPython and a look into using it with each of the
following: WinForms, WPF, Silverlight, and ASP.NET

Python 101 for the .NET Developer

Presented by Sarah Dutkiewicz

The first part of the session will cover the basics of Python - its history,
how its data structures compare to those we're familiar with in the primary
.NET languages, its strong and weak points, who's using it, and why you as a
developer - both generally speaking and as a .NET developer - should care
about Python. The second part of the session will get into the demos -
starting with some basic Python scripts and getting into IronPython scripts,
if time allows. By the end of this session, you'll have an idea of what Python
is, why you should know it as a developer and specifically as a .NET
developer, and how to get setup and write a basic app in both Python and
IronPython.
