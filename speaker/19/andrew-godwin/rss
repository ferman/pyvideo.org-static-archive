Deployment, Daemons, and Datacenters

Presented by Andrew Godwin

A tour through the systems that power [ep.io](http://ep.io/), the Python
hosting platform, from the array of daemons powering the system, to how
redundancy is set up, and also covering general best practices for hosting
Django sites yourself.

Step away from that database

Presented by Andrew Godwin

A look at the large array of database types now available: where each one
excels, why NoSQL isn't always best, and the best ways to integrate them into
your Django project.

Abstract

In the last few years we've seen an explosion in the number of production-
ready databases available for web applications. From relational to document-
oriented, key-value and more, there's a staggering array of choice.

This talk covers the various basic types of database now available, and
highlights their weaknesses, their strengths, and the features you just can't
get from traditional databases.

Then, after a short rant about the term "NoSQL", learn how to best integrate
them into your Django projects, why being schemaless isn't as good as it looks
at first, and how relational databases are keeping up with the times.

Ten years after the project known as "Django" was released to the public, there are still unanswered questions. Why did one of the original authors flee the country? What happened to all the removed magic? And, more importantly, why are there secret messages hidden in the template parser's regular expressions? I'll be attempting to throw light on some of the dark secrets of Django and, perhaps, finally divine its true purpose, after almost a decade of searching.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Andrew Godwin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jul 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3661/django-the-conspiracy</guid><enclosure url="http://youtu.be/s-OPhgYELv4" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/s-OPhgYELv4/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>What can programmers learn from pilots?</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3510/what-can-programmers-learn-from-pilots</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
What can Python-based software teams learn from aviation? Why should software always fail hard? What's wrong with too many error logs? And why are ops people already like pilots? Learn all this, and about planes, too.

Django finally has built-in migrations, and they're a long way from the designs of South or django-evolution. Learn the key design decisions we made, ideas we discarded, and the unique treatment we have to give each of our four official database backends.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Andrew Godwin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2630/designing-djangos-migrations</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-_GAHfpk1Y" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/a-_GAHfpk1Y/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Models and Migrations and Schemas - oh my!</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1412/models-and-migrations-and-schemas-oh-my</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
A look at the past, current and future of schemas, migrations and Django, and
what it means for both website developers and ops staff.


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Django has a long and varied history of dealing with changing schema
requirements - from the early projects like django-evolution and the two
aborted attempts to provide migrations in Django itself, through to projects
like South and now looking ahead to a more integrated solution with Django
itself once more.

This talk will cover some of that history - helpful to get some kind of
context when it comes to current developments - as well as exploring some of
the common problems a migration system (and its users) encounter, and how
those lessons and ideas are being used to help improve Django itself to better
support schema migrations.

[EuroPython 2011] Andrew Godwin - 20 June 2011 in "Track Lasagne"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
At ep.io we built a Python hosting platform from the ground up, designed to
run large numbers of web applications on a small number of physical machines
both securely and in a reasonably scalable way. This talk will show you how we
built our infrastructure - using Redis, eventlet, PostgreSQL and more - and
what lessons we learnt from our first few thousand deploys.

See how we split services into multiple processes and greenthreads; the pains
of building a cooperatively-multitasking PTY module; how Redis isn't the
answer to everything, but is still very useful; how to persuade third-party
software to work securely in a shared environment; and how important it is to
have good logging, especially when you have more than five servers.
