Small acts make great revolutions: crafting Python and Open Source communities
in Rio de Janeiro

  
Presented by Guilherme Chapiewski; Henrique Bastos

  
Even though we are Python lovers, we at PythOnRio (Python's Rio de Janeiro
users group) strongly believe in differences. Programming languages and
technologies are not religions. Why do we have to compete against each other
when we can take advantage of diversity by sharing our knowledge and learning
to use the best tools for each job? By promoting this thinking we are
gathering people from many different open source communities.

  
That's our main recipe for the success of initiatives like Coding Dojo Rio,
PythOnCampus, Dev in Rio, #horaextra and many other social meetings where we
have gathered some of the smartest people in Rio's software development
community.

  
With this philosophy, Rio de Janeiro communities are growing and starting to
jell - they are becoming so strongly knit that the whole is greater than the
sum of the parts.

  
In this talk, we would like to share not only our "methods" and "formulas",
but the values and experiences that are leading us to build a strong and
active community while having lots of fun.
