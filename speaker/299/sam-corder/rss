Getting to know MongoDB using Python and IronPython

Presented by Sam Corder

Is your RDBMS not coping with the load anymore and can't be scaled out any
further? Are you designing the next big thing and know your RDBMS won't be
able to handle it? Are you tired of shoe-horning a data model into where it
doesn't belong? Are you just curious what this thing called MongoDB is? In
this session you will explore a popular alternative to the RDBMS called Mongo
from one who has battled with BSON to write the original .Net driver. You'll
learn basics of schema design, document manipulation, several ways to get at
your data, something odd called map/reduce and all from the comfort of Python
and the slightly uncomfortable IronPython.
