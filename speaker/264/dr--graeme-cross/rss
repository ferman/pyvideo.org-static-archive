Need for Speed

Presented by Dr. Graeme Cross

"Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put
in a speed hack until you have proven that's where the bottleneck is." (Rob
Pike)

Python is a great balance of productivity, expressiveness and performance, but
there are times when it would nice to have a Python application run faster.
This is particularly true for large scale data processing, numerical work,
controlling real world devices, and animation.

Using some real-world examples, this talk covers tools and techniques that
allow you to systematically understand where the bottlenecks are in your code
and then how to effectively optimise your code, without having to resort to
writing modules in C/C++.
