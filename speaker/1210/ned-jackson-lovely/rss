It's inevitable that online communities will change, and that we'll remember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately reflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of articles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is unworthy. We'll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just a \"pip install\" away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ned Jackson Lovely</dc:creator><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3321/enough-machine-learning-make-hacker-news-readable-</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI2jidR4RsI" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xI2jidR4RsI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Cheap Helicopters In My Living Room</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2675/cheap-helicopters-in-my-living-room</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
Using Python and a minimal amount of hardware hacking, it's possible to build computer controlled helicopters you can fly around your living room for surprisingly small amounts of money. This talk will describe the steps you'll need to take to start the ball rolling towards Skynet using a $20 helicopter and an Arduino.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Ned Jackson Lovely</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2675/cheap-helicopters-in-my-living-room</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ1vjr1dDqw" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/jJ1vjr1dDqw/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Enough Machine Learning to Make Hacker News Readable Again</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2612/enough-machine-learning-to-make-hacker-news-reada</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
