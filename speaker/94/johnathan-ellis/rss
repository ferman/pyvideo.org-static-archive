Introduction to SQLAlchemy

Presented by Johnathan Ellis

SQLAlchemy is the premier SQL toolkit for Python. SQLAlchemy exposes the full
power of SQL while remaining easy to use for the basics, and is flexible
enough to work with existing database schemas as well as fresh designs.
SQLAlchemy is used in production by leading Python web frameworks Pylons and
Turbogears as well as many other web and non-web developers.

This tutorial teaches SQLAlchemy's object-relational mapping to automate
painlessly loading and persisting objects from and to your database, even when
complex relationships exist.

Intended Audience

Python experience: intermediate. You should already have some hands-on
experience with Python and be comfortable reading modern Python code.

SQL experience: beginning. You should know how to SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE,
and how to read queries involving JOINs, but we will only be reading the SQL
generated by SA, not writing our own.

ORM experience: prior experience with an object-relational mapper is not
necessary.

Class Outline

Introduction:

  * Philosophy 
  * SA features 

Fundamentals:

  * Introduction to ORM 
  * Data Mapper pattern vs Active Record 
  * Tables 
  * Mapping basics 

Queries:

  * Conditions, operators 
  * Joins 
  * lazy / eager loading 
  * Relation-based queries 

Sessions &amp; identity map:

  * detatching, attaching objects 
  * Lifecycle relations 

More Mapping:

  * one to one, many to many 
  * backreferences 

Extensions, etc.:

  * DDL 
  * Migrate 
  * FormAlchemy 
  * SqlSoup 
  * Elixir 

Requirements

Laptop with Python 2.5 or 2.6 and SQLAlchemy 0.6 installed. Code samples may
also work with Python 2.4 but will not be tested on that platform. SQLAlchemy
also supports Jython and cPython 3.x, but this tutorial will be using
"classic" cPython.
