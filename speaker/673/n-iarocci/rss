[EuroPython 2012] N Iarocci - 4 JULY 2012 in "Track Tagliatelle"


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
In the last year we have been working on a full featured, Python powered,
RESTful Web API. We learned quite a few things on REST best patterns, and we
got a chance to put Python’s renowned web capabilities under review, even
releasing a couple Open Source projects in the process. In my talk I will
share what we learned. We will consider ‘pure’ REST API design and its many
hurdles. We will look at what Python as to offer in this field and finally, we
will dig further down by looking at some of the code we developed. Some of the
technologies/stacks I’ll cover are (in no particular order): Flask, PyMongo,
MongoDB, REST, JSON, XML, Heroku. Did you know? Like it or not, there is going
to be a REST API in your future.
