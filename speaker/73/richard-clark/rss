The Living Coder

Presented by Richard Clark

Abstract

Tales, anecdotes philosophy and musings about the life that surrounds the code
we write.

Outline

The project manager called me to his office and said "I know you did this in
two weeks in perl, but applications here must be written in java, because java
programmers are much easier to find". When I left 6 months later, the same
manager said "You wouldn't happen to know any java programmers would you? we
have nobody to replace you..". This is the story of the life that exists
around the code we write.
