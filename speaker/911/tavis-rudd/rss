I dictate my code using a voice recognition system with Python embedded in it.  In a fast paced live demo, I will code a small system and deploy it without touching the keyboard. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose.
&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Two years ago I developed a case of Emacs Pinkie (RSI) so severe my hands went numb and I could no longer type or work. Desperate, I tried voice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but, as I couldn’t type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had by hand.

In a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python, plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose. It’s now a highly effective tool that could benefit all programmers. </description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tavis Rudd</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 17 Mar 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1735/using-python-to-code-by-voice</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/Using_Python_to_Code_by_Voice.mp4?Signature=8iV87JN7k7IweE10nJanN%2FAUdVY%3D&amp;Expires=1363825863&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/nextdayvideo/psf/pycon2013/Using_Python_to_Code_by_Voice.mp4?Signature=8iV87JN7k7IweE10nJanN%2FAUdVY%3D&amp;Expires=1363825863&amp;AWSAccessKeyId=FEWGReWX3QbNk0h3" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/8SkdfdXWYaI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
