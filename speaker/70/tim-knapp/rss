Why the Pyramid web framework and Google App Engine was a perfect fit for a $0 SaaS app for a not-for-profit. Some features of Pyramid will be covered as well as how we run it on Google App Engine, all in the context of the SaaS app that we developed.

Intermediate

**Abstract**

Given the number of small businesses and not-for-profit organisations in New Zealand, this talk is about sharing how I've used free software, i.e. the Pyramid web framework [1], on top of a free hosting service, Google App Engine. Pyramid is a 'non-opinionated' web framework and therefore enables you to pick-and-choose what packages you'd like to use in your software stack, making it very flexible and easy to develop your custom application with. I'll go through some of the features of Pyramid that we're using in our app with code examples. I'll also briefly cover some of the other free web services we're using in our app and how these all fit together with the Pyramid-based app.
