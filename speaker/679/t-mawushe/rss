&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
These days it is difficult for software to meet users’ expectations to behave
intelligently. When a program displays a lack of even the most basic awareness
of context it is jarring. At the same time organisations are seeking to gain a
competitive advantage through software that behaves adaptively based on the
information at hand. Solving these problems is a challenge for today’s
developers. There is general agreement among seasoned developers that having a
good understanding of basic computer science data structures and algorithms is
essential. That said there is one sub-section of algorithms that is underused
by most developers, the algorithms that fall under the general rubric of
Artificial Intelligence. This talk aims to remedy that by providing a quick
refresher course on basic AI algorithms using Python. This talk is not about
building thinking machines, but rather about creating software that users
won’t think is stupid. Basic AI techniques such as Constraint Propagation and
Identification Trees, can really help developers along the road to smarter
software.
