Why Django Sucks, and How We Can Fix It

Presented by Eric Florenzano

Eric Florenzano trolls DjangoCon. He identifies problems with Django ranging
from app structure, to settings, to the development process, to the community,
and more. Some of the problems he identifies have been around since the
beginning, and some are emerging as Django matures. It's not all gloomâ€”the
latter half of the talk focuses on proposals on how to tackle these issues
that face Django.

Abstract

This talk focuses on real problems that people face when using Django every
day. It dives down and attempts to find root causes for each of these
problems. Essentially, what are the things that suck about Django?

Then the talk walks point-by-point for each of the things that suck, and
provides suggestions for actions that the Django community can take to make
them suck less.

The goal here is to start a discussion, to bring to light the problems that
tend to be ignored, and to have a little fun in the process.

Mobile grows bigger each year, but we love the web, and Django. Where does our
knowledge and experience fit in this new ecosystem? What kind of a role can
Django play on fast-growing platforms like iOS and Android?


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
# Intro

  * Django's version of MVC vs. iOS/Android version of MVC
  * How the platforms differ from Django
  * What is similar to Django

# API

  * Easiest way for Django to be used in conjunction with mobile today
  * Big fat requests with lots of data preferable to many smaller requests
  * Authentication best practices for mobile backend APIs

# PhoneGap

  * Can actually use Django to build your mobile app today
  * JavaScript tricks to get around things like tap delay
  * How much Django is really used vs. how much JavaScript
  * Offline caching
  * Performance issues with this approach

# Future

  * Quick look at RubyMotion
  * Turns out it's possible to cross-compile Python for iOS
  * Android has Py4A (including interpreter embedding)
  * What can be done with this? Mobile Django.

# Conclusion

  * They are different worlds, need to be careful to respect both
  * Even today Django proves useful as an API layer
  * Django web apps in native wrapper can be a solution, albeit with its issues
  * As hardware gets better, we may see something like an embedded Django

Dude, Where's My Database?

  
Presented by Eric Florenzano (Django)

  
There are so many great open source databases out on the market right now--
we're really in the golden age of databases. Fortunately, Python can talk to
virtually all of them. With so many databases at our disposal, how do we
choose which one to use for our particular use case?

  
This talk will go over the many different classes of databases, introduce some
of the particular implementations for each class of database, and describe the
strengths and weaknesses of each. By weighing the pros and cons of each type
of database, the speaker hopes to dispel the many rumors and misconceptions
that people have about what's out there today.
