&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
libcloud is an open-source client library for interacting with different cloud
providers.

The primary goal of the library is to abstract all the provider differences
away and expose common functionality in a nice, clean and concise API.

This talk will address the following topics:

  * Why a library like this was built in the first place
  * Different problems we have encountered while building it (not all the providers always play nice)
  * An introduction to the library API (compute, storage and load-balancer part)
  * How to use it to build something useful and fun
  * How to participate and contribute
  * Roadmap and plans for the future

Cloudkick is a server management and monitoring software as a service used by
thousands of different companies all across the globe.

The service is built in and powered by many different programming languages
and technologies, but the web application and majority of the backend services
are written in Python.

In this talk I will present how and where we use Python (Django, Twisted,
txamqp, Piston, …), different problems we have encountered while building our
service and how we worked around them, good practices and real-world advices
on building effective Twisted services and much more.
