In an ideal world, you can join on candidate keys, names are never misspelt, people never move house, and I have a pony. I donâ€™t have a pony. But we do have record linkage. 

Record linkage (also known as data linkage or fuzzy record matching) is a naive Bayes algorithm which matches data about individuals across databases or within a single database, by constructing the probabilities that two records apply to the same individual or to different individuals.

In this talk I will discuss the techniques of record linkage in Python, the usefulness and the limitations of linkage, and the effect that this technique is having on healthcare research in particular.

Healthcare/epidemiology studies often require data from more than one source, and individuals frequently have multiple interactions with a data set without a unique identifier. The outcomes of these studies are only as good as the record linkage which underlies them, so the ways in which record linkage is done can have a direct impact on our ability to understand, prevent and treat serious medical conditions.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Rhydwyn Mcguire</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3115/record-linkage-join-for-real-life-by-rhydwyn-mcg</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/35-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/35-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEcVIjyHfiQ" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/cEcVIjyHfiQ/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>RPy: Powerful Analytics within python</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/1622/rpy-powerful-analytics-within-python</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
R is an incredibly powerful statistical programming language. It is the choice
for powerful set and forgets analytics. However it is a specialist language
without strong functionality in other areas. In areas where significant
preprocessing of data, or where the statistics produced are part of a larger
system such as looking for patterns in the load behaviour of a web server, a
match with a strong general language is an obvious solution. Because of its
wide use and potential integration with R, python is that language.

This talk will be targeted at python programmers who wish to integrate
statistical and data analysis into their work, providing options for real time
data monitoring and analysis. This talk is accessible for anyone with a basic
understanding of python.
