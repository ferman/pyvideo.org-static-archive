OpenBlock is an open-source project aiming to provide a framework for "hyper-
local" civic data. We've been using OpenBlock in a project focused on
increasing access to public records in rural North Carolina communities. In
this talk we provide an overview of OpenBlock and how to get started using it,
we describe our experience using it, and discuss some extensions we have made
to it.

# Abstract

What do you do if EveryBlock isn't available in your city? OpenBlock, released
to the community from the Knight-funded project, EveryBlock.com, is a
neighborhood news project aiming to provide a framework for "hyper-local"
civic data. Over the past few years, the open source project has been
maintained by the non-profit OpenPlans. Their goal was to simplify and
accelerate adoption of OpenBlock by making it easier to use. Today, Caktus is
working with Ryan Thornburg of the UNC School of Journalism and Mass
Communication to bring OpenBlock to rural North Carolina newspapers. Open
Rural aims to leverage OpenBlock to increase access to public records in small
communities. This talk focuses on our experience with OpenBlock as we work to
deploy OpenRural in North Carolina.
