&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
After half a lifetime "undercover as a man" I transitioned from male to female while staying involved in the Python community. This talk discusses that transition and explores how I found life in Python as a woman different from my former life as a man and the lessons about diversity I have learned.

This talk will include a brief discussion of what being transgender means, my experiences as I came to terms with it, and the losses and gains transition entailed. Early on I made the decision to be as open as possible and to stay engaged in the Python community as I transitioned and I will discuss why I made that decision and the levels of acceptance and support I encountered.

Transition has been wonderfully successful, but that very transition put me in a surprisingly different world. Now being part of not one, but at least 3 groups that are minorities in the Python world gave me a very different view of a community I thought I knew, and pushed me to being an activist (or trouble maker) in spite of myself. In addition to the many positives the Python community has offered me on my journey, I will discuss the experiences that have made me understand that privilege is very much alive and well in the Python world.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Naomi Ceder</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2956/farewell-and-welcome-home-python-in-two-genders-0</guid><enclosure url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR0RwMHIzQ8" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/CR0RwMHIzQ8/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Farewell and Welcome Home: Python in Two Genders</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2671/farewell-and-welcome-home-python-in-two-genders</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
