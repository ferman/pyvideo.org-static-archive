[EuroPython 2011] Andrew Mleczko - 22 June 2011 in "Track Ravioli "


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Web development is a complexity challenge nowadays. Growing number of
functionalities results in customer expectations increase which makes project
design more difficult. Using proper tools that suite your customer needs is
essential.

In this talk I would like to present two successful stories using closely
together Pyramid and Plone. Basing on these examples I wished to highlight the
main reasons for using Plone as a CMS only and letting Pyramid do the rest
(vertical application). Moreover, I will underscore good and bad practices
during integration process and how to make farsighted architectural decisions
in a right moment.

Prerequisites: be familiarized with common python web framework concepts.
