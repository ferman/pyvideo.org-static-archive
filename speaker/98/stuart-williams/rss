A very fast introduction to Python for software developers with experience in other languages.  Instead of a traditional top-down presentation of Python's features, syntax, and semantics, students are immersed in the language bottom-up with hundreds of small examples using the interactive interpreter to quickly gain familiarity with most of the core language features.

This tutorial is for developers who've been using Python for a while and would consider themselves at an intermediate level, but are looking for a deeper understanding of the language.  It focuses on how Python differs from other languages in subtle but important ways that are often confusing, and it demystifies a number of language features that are sometimes misunderstood.

Python 101

Presented by Stuart Williams

This half-day tutorial presents the basics of Python to beginning and
intermediate programmers. It pairs well with ''Python 102'' which follows a
similar outline but goes much deeper.

Rather than starting with "Hello, world!", we use the interactive Python
interpreter shell to get hands-on familiarity with much of core Python before
covering blocks and scripts.

The tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and hands-
on exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground.

Advanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in "extra credit"
exercises such that more advanced participants can learn at their own pace.

Intended Audience

Programmers with experience in other languages who want a fast hands-on
introduction to Python. Content will target both Python 3.1 and 2.6.

Requirements

Bring a laptop computer with Python 2.6 or 3.1 installed. Try to get as much
of an overview of Python before the tutorial as you have time to in order to
get more out of the tutorial. Two angles on this are the Python Quick
Reference and the Python website's tutorial.

Class Outline

  * Numbers and operators 
  * Strings - immutability, operators, methods, functions, and formatting 
  * Introspection/Discovery 
  * Tuples and Lists 
  * List Comprehensions 
  * Objects and Names 
  * Dictionaries 
  * Loops and Blocks 
  * Iterables 
  * Generator Expressions 
  * Functions 
  * Generators 
  * Namespaces 
  * Simple Classes 
  * Exceptions

Python 102

Presented by Stuart Williams

This half-day tutorial presents intermediate and some advanced features of
Python to beginning and intermediate programmers. It pairs well with Python
101 which follows a similar outline but at a more introductory level.

Rather than starting with "Hello, world!", we use the interactive Python
interpreter shell to get hands-on familiarity with much of core Python before
covering blocks and scripts.

The tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and hands-
on exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground.

Advanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in "extra credit"
exercises such that more advanced participants can learn at their own pace.

Intended Audience

introduction to intermediate and some advanced features of Python. Content
will target both Python 3.1 and 2.6.

Class Outline

  * Numbers and Strings - operators, functions and methods 
  * Introspection 
  * Sequences - overview, concepts, and methods 
  * Objects 
  * Dictionaries 
  * Files 
  * Classes 
  * Namespaces 
  * Dynamic Classes 
  * Iterators and Generators 
  * Functions 
  * Exceptions 
  * Standard Library
