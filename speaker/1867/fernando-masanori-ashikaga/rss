Data Structures is traditionally a “bogeyman” discipline in Computer Science courses and has a high degree of failure. In FATEC São José dos Campos we are adopting a hybrid approach, with C and Python languages. The failure rate decreased from 85% (2008) to 12% (2014). The talk will be extensively illustrated with code in C and Python, addressing the various concepts taught in this course.

Python for Zombies is the first MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) in portuguese. With a team made up of three folks and no budget, we have reached 30.000 enrollments in one year and half. After having taken the course, some former girl students even founded the first PyLadies groups in Brazil, with great impact in diversity (RuPy Natal: 300+ 1/3 women, Code Girl 2: 700+ 60% women). This MOOC also have a great impact in Python community: I gave 40 talk’s and short courses in 2014!
