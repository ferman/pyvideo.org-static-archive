[EuroPython 2011] Todd Trichler - 23 June 2011 in "Training Pizza Napoli "


&lt;p&gt;Description&lt;/p&gt;
Have you ever wanted or perhaps needed to access data stored in a corporate
Oracle database from within your Python environment?

This session will help developers get up and running using Python with Oracle:
- Learn the basics of working with cx_Oracle - Learn how to use VirtualBox to
set up a Python &amp; Oracle test and developement environment. - Discover
features within Oracle that you can use to build more performant python based
applications. - Leave with all the resources you need to certify your python
app to run against a production Oracle11gR2 database, or hone those skills for
the next job. - Get a quick intro to Oracle Linux along the way.

No prior experience with Oracle is required, some basic understanding of
databases would be helpful.

Look forward to meeting you @ EuroPython 2011 - Todd
