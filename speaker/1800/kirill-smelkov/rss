This talk introduces a new implementation of NumPy arrays that provides support for out­of­core data analysis without changing code, without breaking APIs and without losing the performance advantage provided by FORTRAN libraries or just­in­time compilers. wendelin­core acts transparently as distributed shared virtual memory manager for binary data handled by python interpreters deployed on a cluster. Thanks to wendelin­ core, each python interpreter can access elementary ndarray structures of virtually 2 exabytes in a single memory block, whatever the amount of RAM available on each node. With wendelin­core, a cluster of inexpensive PCs can thus act as a teramory server at much lower cost. A cluster of tera­-memory servers can act as an examemory machine.

    In addition to bringing true BIg Data support to NumPy libraries, wendelin­core also provides native persistency of ndarrays thanks to its integration with NEO database. NEO together with wendelin­core can shard and store ndarrays on a redundant array of inexpensive computers and provide native support for python exception handling, thus enforcing a rollback of any change made to data in case of bug or error during a calculation.

    The talk will focus on the technical aspects of wendelin­-core. It will explain the technical approach that has been used for the first implementation: what has been achieved, what is still weak, what can be improved. It will explain how to hook wendelin­-core to a persistency layer. It will then present the technical roadmap and suggest how to integrate wendelin­core to other persistency layers or to other data structures.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Kirill Smelkov</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3528/out-of-core-numpy-arrays-without-changing-your-co</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQWK9qQubAc" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aQWK9qQubAc/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
