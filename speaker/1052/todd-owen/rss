Ansible is a configuration management tool, written in Python, that has taken the world of IT automation by storm. Its most remarkable quality is simplicity.

The Zen of Python is a set of aphorisms which capture the design philosophy of the Python language, one being "Simple is better than complex".

In this talk, weâ€™ll look at some of the concrete ways that Ansible embodies the Zen of Python, in an attempt to unravel the true meaning of the sometimes cryptic aphorisms. Along the way we will consider why simplicity is a such good thing, yet tantalisingly out of reach in most software projects.

A good suite of tests is a programmer's best friend. But a poorly designed testing strategy can result in tests that are unwieldy, fragile, and above all no fun to write or maintain.

This talk will offer a smorgasbord of testing ideas, ranging from simple tips and tricks to fully-fledged testing frameworks for Python. We will touch on automation, table-based testing, round-trip testing, UI testing, property checking, testing Twisted Python applications, and more. Be prepared to think outside the box, as we will see that testing is an area where creativity and pragmatism pay off better than following a rigid set of rules.

Everyone should come away with a few new ideas, and renewed enthusiasm for test-driven development!</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Todd Owen</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2225/testing-choose-your-weapons</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/Testing_Choose_Your_Weapons.mp4" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/Testing_Choose_Your_Weapons.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLlEi6-8YBI" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/RLlEi6-8YBI/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
