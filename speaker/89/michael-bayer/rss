SQLAlchemy is the object relational mapper and database toolkit for Python,
first introduced in 2005. In this talk I'll describe why SQLAlchemy has always
been called a "toolkit", detailing the software construction mindset for which
SQLAlchemy was designed to be used with - what I am currently referring to as
the "Hand Coded" approach.

Advanced SQLAlchemy

Presented by Michael Bayer

SQLAlchemy is the premier SQL toolkit for Python. SQLAlchemy exposes the full
power of SQL while remaining easy to use for the basics, and is flexible
enough to work with existing database schemas as well as fresh designs.
SQLAlchemy is used in production by leading Python web frameworks Pylons and
TurboGears as well as many other web and non-web developers.

This tutorial discusses current data mapping techniques, advanced Query
techniques, Session/transaction usage, and maximizing schema usage with
SQLAlchemy's event model.

Intended Audience

Python experience: intermediate. You should already have some hands-on
experience with Python and be comfortable reading modern Python code.

SQL experience: intermediate. We will use subselects and outer joins as part
of the SQL layer.

ORM experience: prior experience with SQLAlchemy is recommended.
