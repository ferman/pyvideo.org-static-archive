Deep Learning, anyone who has followed machine learning over the past years has heard it. In this talk I will go past the hype and show what deep learning actually means and how one goes about solving complex machine learning task with a minimum amount of code, with the help of theano, an amazing python library for deep learning. I will show examples from my own research in language and vision, and hope to show that Deep Learning is not only fun, but also not as difficult as one might expect.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Roelof Pieters</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3641/deep-learning-and-deep-data-science</guid><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBKfGaakFp8" length="None" type="video/flv"></enclosure><media:thumbnail url="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wBKfGaakFp8/maxresdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
