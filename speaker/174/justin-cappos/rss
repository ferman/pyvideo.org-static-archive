A Python-based Platform for Easy Development and Deployment of Networked
Systems and Applications

  
Presented by Ivan Beschastnikh, Justin Samuel, and Justin Cappos

  
Seattle is an open-source platform for developing and deploying networked
applications. Core feature of Seattle is that it allows safe execution of
untrusted code on end-user systems. In our talk we look at how we used Python
to build a safe, restricted code execution environment for Seattle that not
only provides execution safety but also enforces strict resource consumption
limits. In addition, Seattle includes a high-level API to hide inconsistent
OS-specific behaviors from developers. What results is a platform that
welcomes the participation of end-user machines for general-purpose
distributed programming and creates new possibilities for developers.
