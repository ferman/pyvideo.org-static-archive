Software Carpentry is a volunteer organisation that teaches basic software skills to researchers in science, engineering and medicine. Supported by the Mozilla Science Lab, it runs two-day bootcamps all over the world, provides open access material for self-paced instruction, and runs a training program for aspiring instructors. The core two-day curriculum includes the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive tasks); Python or R (and how to grow a program in a modular, testable way); Git and GitHub (and how to track and share work efficiently); and SQL (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).     

While the organisation has been around for over a decade, it had a breakout year in 2013. The number of qualified instructors swelled to over 100 and collectively they ran over 100 events for over 4300 researchers in a dozen countries. To kick things off in Australia, the founder of Software Carpentry (Dr. Greg Wilson) visited Sydney and Melbourne in February 2013 to host the first ever bootcamps outside of Europe and North America. Since that visit five local instructors have been trained up and have delivered an additional ten bootcamps around the country.

This presentation will review the first year of Software Carpentry activities in Australia, with a particular focus on the key lessons learned in teaching computational best practices to the research community. Future plans and directions will also be outlined, including an overview of an innovative new project called the Research Bazaar. Coordinated out of The University of Melbourne, this project has started offering regular bootcamps to researchers in the Melbourne area and looks set to inspire widespread institutional support for bootcamp delivery. The Software Carpentry teaching materials are also undergoing rapid development, with work on an advanced curriculum and new lessons on “data carpentry” already underway. There are very few examples of open, collaborative lesson development in the education sector, so the application of routine software development practices in this space (e.g. version control, pull requests, and the progressive release of new versions) is somewhat ground breaking.</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Damien Irving</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3092/software-carpentry-in-australia-current-activity</guid><enclosure url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/43-out.ogv" length="None" type="video/ogg"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/43-out.ogv" mime_type="video/ogg"></media:content><media:content url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ12NmsLfsg" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/sQ12NmsLfsg/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item><item><title>Software Carpentry arrives Down Under!</title><link>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2230/software-carpentry-arrives-down-under</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Abstract&lt;/p&gt;
Scientists are required to do more and more programming these days,  however they are almost always self-taught. They spend a large percentage of their time wrestling with software, reinvent a lot of wheels, and still don’t know if their results are reliable. For proficient software developers, particularly those employed to assist these scientists, this computational illiteracy is easy to identify, but much harder to remedy. What do you teach a scientist, given their time constraints, background knowledge and work requirements? This presentation will give an answer to that question, by describing what gets taught at a Software Carpentry boot camp.

Software Carpentry is a volunteer organisation that has been teaching basic software development to scientists for over a decade. Supported by the Sloan Foundation and Mozilla, Software Carpentry has refined its teaching methods over time and has recently settled on a model centred around the delivery of intensive short courses known as “boot camps”. Institutions such as Oxford University, MIT, University of California Berkeley and the International Centre for Theoretical Physics have all hosted boot camps in the past 12 months.     

Dr. Greg Wilson, the founder of Software Carpentry, flew out to Australia in February 2013 to host a series of two day boot camps with the Genes to Geoscience Research Centre in Sydney and the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (AMOS) and ARC Centre for Excellence in Climate System Science in Melbourne. These two events were the first ever boot camps held outside of North America and Europe, were booked out in a matter of days, and received rave reviews from participants. Given this success, there are already plans afoot to host a pair of boot camps for the bioinformatics community in Brisbane and Adelaide later this year, plus another for the weather/climate community in Hobart. 

This presentation will describe what gets taught at a Software Carpentry boot camp (hint: there's lots of Python), how it's taught and why it's so effective (hint: we take an evidence-based approach to teaching). All Software Carpentry teaching materials can be freely re-used under open access licenses, so at the conclusion of the talk you can take anything you've learned and apply it to your own work and/or teaching. Better still, you'll find out how to join the Australian Software Carpentry team, so that you can organise and/or teach a boot camp for your own discipline.        </description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Damien Irving</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2013 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2230/software-carpentry-arrives-down-under</guid><enclosure url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/Software_Carpentry_arrives_Dow.mp4" length="None" type="video/mp4"></enclosure><media:group><media:content url="http://s3.us.archive.org/ndvpyconau2013/Software_Carpentry_arrives_Dow.mp4" mime_type="video/mp4"></media:content><media:content url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AGgugxn4RM" mime_type="video/flv"></media:content></media:group><media:thumbnail url="http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/-AGgugxn4RM/hqdefault.jpg"></media:thumbnail></item></channel></rss>
